You have entered the amount 2000.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/689-0
00:19:01.316 --> 00:19:03.636
Pelons after withdrawing this much.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/691-0
00:19:05.116 --> 00:19:05.836
What even do?

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/706-0
00:19:15.956 --> 00:19:24.676
It will be drawn this one deposit if we
have the balance also. So how we will do?

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/711-0
00:19:26.396 --> 00:19:30.356
Three things you have to do.
Then you reuse Elsif.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/730-0
00:20:38.476 --> 00:20:47.196
Yes, can we use and I can we use?

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/733-0
00:20:51.676 --> 00:20:53.476
Anything you can write?

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/740-0
00:20:55.236 --> 00:20:59.036
You can write. This is the variable.
You can write a num.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/768-0
00:21:02.596 --> 00:21:08.877
Why we will give that name just to
because this is just the meaningful for

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/768-1
00:21:08.877 --> 00:21:15.157
what purpose we are going to use.
This is a variable you can use anything.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/768-2
00:21:15.157 --> 00:21:16.916
We are at the number.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/783-0
00:21:36.396 --> 00:21:40.627
If someone else will see your code,
he will understand why you have declared

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/783-1
00:21:40.627 --> 00:21:41.396
that variable.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/787-0
00:21:44.836 --> 00:21:46.636
Could be anything.
This is the variable name.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/788-0
00:21:52.796 --> 00:21:53.036
Right.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/792-0
00:21:59.556 --> 00:22:00.996
Or you can need option.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/800-0
00:22:02.436 --> 00:22:04.996
Option.
There is an option there's equal to.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/810-0
00:22:07.396 --> 00:22:10.960
Anything not necessarily only,
but what do you like here?

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/810-1
00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.356
You are right here as well, same thing.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/818-0
00:22:15.636 --> 00:22:20.236
That's why I have started from the
variable constant all these things.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/826-0
00:22:38.876 --> 00:22:40.436
Keywords. These are the keywords.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/847-0
00:22:45.356 --> 00:22:48.924
No. See, you can't run all the keywords,
right?

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/847-1
00:22:48.924 --> 00:22:54.869
So it means you can't remember all the
keywords, right? So once they will come,

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/847-2
00:22:54.869 --> 00:22:56.356
you will check them.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/849-0
00:23:00.956 --> 00:23:02.316
Uh, see here.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/852-0
00:23:03.476 --> 00:23:04.836
All Python keywords.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/861-0
00:23:10.116 --> 00:23:15.156
There's a list of keywords.
These are the keywords, for example.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/906-0
00:23:16.756 --> 00:23:20.287
The the but this way you can't.
We can't work.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/906-1
00:23:20.287 --> 00:23:26.148
Actually the keyword says the special
words that have the special meaning for

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/906-2
00:23:26.148 --> 00:23:31.107
the for the programming.
Like for example you have studied the if

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/906-3
00:23:31.107 --> 00:23:35.916
else right? You have done the if else.
So this if is a keyword.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/944-0
00:23:36.356 --> 00:23:40.581
And else is a keyword so you can't use it
later on, right?

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/944-1
00:23:40.581 --> 00:23:45.880
So you can't do like you have learned all
the keywords and remember them.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/944-2
00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:50.677
That way you can't work right.
The way working is once you we have

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/944-3
00:23:50.677 --> 00:23:52.396
discussed the let's say.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/985-0
00:23:53.156 --> 00:23:57.217
We have discussed if else, right?
So that time you have seen if is a

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/985-1
00:23:57.217 --> 00:24:01.337
keyword, else is a keyword.
So then it should be in your mind this is

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/985-2
00:24:01.337 --> 00:24:04.104
the keyword.
Now you have done the four while,

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/985-3
00:24:04.104 --> 00:24:08.636
so now it should be in your mind this
four is a keyword, while is a keyword.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1015-0
00:24:08.996 --> 00:24:13.224
Then you have done the classes,
so class is a keyword.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1015-1
00:24:13.224 --> 00:24:18.836
Then inside this we have done function in
the function def is a keyword.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1015-2
00:24:18.836 --> 00:24:24.756
This is define is a keyword here today.
I also have told you that here is a.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1064-0
00:24:24.756 --> 00:24:29.247
The self is a keyword,
this is a parameter self and the def is a

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1064-1
00:24:29.247 --> 00:24:34.498
keyword. This is a built-in function,
so this is a keyword here inside this

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1064-2
00:24:34.498 --> 00:24:39.818
class and then the print is a keyword.
You know now print is going to do the

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1064-3
00:24:39.818 --> 00:24:44.516
command that the command instruction you
are going to give to some.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1114-0
00:24:44.516 --> 00:24:48.542
That is a keyword so you can't use it.
Print for example input.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1114-1
00:24:48.542 --> 00:24:53.450
Now you will not make the mistake for
input to use somewhere because you know

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1114-2
00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:58.105
the input is for taking the values.
So similarly once you know the things

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1114-3
00:24:58.105 --> 00:25:02.069
then you will automatically understand
these are the keywords.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1114-4
00:25:02.069 --> 00:25:03.956
So keywords are special words.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1129-0
00:25:04.196 --> 00:25:10.460
That have some meaning for the compiler,
for the programming compilation, right?

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1129-1
00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:15.796
So one have read the hand for those. Yes,
you want to say something.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1131-0
00:25:16.036 --> 00:25:18.156
Yes, Sir. I have a question, Sir.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1132-0
00:25:18.116 --> 00:25:18.756
Yeah, please.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1142-0
00:25:19.476 --> 00:25:25.156
In the loop you put choice equal to what?

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1138-0
00:25:22.076 --> 00:25:22.556
Mhm.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1178-0
00:25:26.516 --> 00:25:30.869
We have not put the loop,
we have just taken the value and we have

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1146-0
00:25:26.676 --> 00:25:26.716
Uh.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1178-1
00:25:30.869 --> 00:25:36.132
do it. I have done it without the loop.
If you want to do it in the loop then we

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1163-0
00:25:33.356 --> 00:25:34.116
Uh, yes.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1178-2
00:25:36.132 --> 00:25:38.796
will write it inside the loop also right?

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1194-0
00:25:39.916 --> 00:25:45.114
OK, choose equal to one.
It will go to AC deposit, right?

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1186-0
00:25:44.636 --> 00:25:44.756
Right.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1194-1
00:25:45.114 --> 00:25:49.236
What if we put #3?
It still go to a withdraw?

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1232-0
00:25:49.796 --> 00:25:55.590
If it will go to the withdraw,
so you want to handle that situation,

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1232-1
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:59.536
right?
So we can write if is equal to equal to

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1232-2
00:25:59.536 --> 00:26:04.826
two, then the withdraw, right?
So that I was about to ask you.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1232-3
00:26:04.826 --> 00:26:09.276
That's why I'm not right.
Let me show you otherwise.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1234-0
00:26:10.756 --> 00:26:10.996
Girls.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1236-0
00:26:12.836 --> 00:26:14.556
We have rate here.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1237-0
00:26:17.196 --> 00:26:17.316
Read.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1239-0
00:26:20.796 --> 00:26:21.076
Wrong choice.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1261-0
00:26:23.956 --> 00:26:31.066
Fine. So now it will. Is it OK now?
And if you write the third one, third one,

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1250-0
00:26:29.916 --> 00:26:30.276
Yes.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1261-1
00:26:31.066 --> 00:26:35.836
for example #3,
you want to get the balance 3 years.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1262-0
00:26:39.156 --> 00:26:39.516
Balance.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1263-0
00:26:41.996 --> 00:26:42.556
Info.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1273-0
00:26:44.036 --> 00:26:49.356
It is balanced for so you want to go to
the three as well, so if.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1278-0
00:26:51.596 --> 00:26:54.716
of is equal to equal to

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1285-0
00:26:57.476 --> 00:27:00.796
Three. Then what we will do?
We want to call this one.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1288-0
00:27:03.036 --> 00:27:06.676
AC dot show.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1300-0
00:27:08.756 --> 00:27:14.423
We'll show you the holder name and the
account balance. Otherwise wrong choice,

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1300-1
00:27:14.423 --> 00:27:14.636
OK.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1367-0
00:29:55.876 --> 00:30:01.163
So someone have put in the this one group
with the list of keywords,

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1367-1
00:30:01.163 --> 00:30:06.373
but these are not all keywords.
So few of these if you want to just

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1367-2
00:30:06.373 --> 00:30:07.676
remember then to.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1368-0
00:30:12.396 --> 00:30:12.756
Sir.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1369-0
00:30:13.316 --> 00:30:13.556
There.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1370-0
00:30:13.756 --> 00:30:14.116
Yeah.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1377-0
00:30:14.996 --> 00:30:17.876
What's the difference between?

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1401-0
00:30:15.676 --> 00:30:21.514
This these are not all, but yes,
just to get the idea, it's good.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1401-1
00:30:21.514 --> 00:30:27.618
You can memorize. Otherwise,
by the time you will understand all the

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1401-2
00:30:27.618 --> 00:30:29.476
keywords, absolutely.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1411-0
00:30:30.956 --> 00:30:36.462
That's good, but for review it's good.
They can this page will help them out.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1411-1
00:30:36.462 --> 00:30:38.156
You can go through that.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1463-0
00:30:43.036 --> 00:30:48.219
See here. That's why I showed you here.
Also this is the list of keywords.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1463-1
00:30:48.219 --> 00:30:53.402
There is the folds of it and all.
But during the time you will get to know

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1463-2
00:30:53.402 --> 00:30:57.548
the Python exception handling.
We are going to do the next.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1463-3
00:30:57.548 --> 00:31:00.796
Next we are going to do the this one
packages.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1470-0
00:31:01.676 --> 00:31:05.125
And uh,
the modules and after that we will start

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1470-1
00:31:05.125 --> 00:31:07.236
the exception handling, right?

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1476-0
00:31:12.276 --> 00:31:14.156
Today we will go for packages and modules.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1487-0
00:31:16.516 --> 00:31:22.400
Exception handling will do tomorrow.
Few things if we will cover today it will

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1487-1
00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:22.996
be good.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1507-0
00:32:37.076 --> 00:32:37.396
Done.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1516-0
00:33:00.676 --> 00:33:03.977
For example,
one you have entered central amount

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1516-1
00:33:03.977 --> 00:33:04.516
deposit.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1519-0
00:33:14.396 --> 00:33:16.036
Where it's going to?

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1524-0
00:33:21.996 --> 00:33:25.476
And it's giving the.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1528-0
00:33:43.116 --> 00:33:44.476
Will you use a leaf?

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1531-0
00:33:47.316 --> 00:33:48.076
Hmm else if.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1543-0
00:33:49.276 --> 00:33:53.691
That's it.
So if any of these the conditions we'll

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1543-1
00:33:53.691 --> 00:33:55.596
go here view terminal.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1548-0
00:33:57.556 --> 00:33:59.396
Here is CLS.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1557-0
00:34:00.596 --> 00:34:06.916
We'll go here one for deposit and amount
something something.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1604-0
00:34:08.316 --> 00:34:11.882
Balance after deposited this week.
So we have rate LG.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1604-1
00:34:11.882 --> 00:34:17.264
If this condition is true then this part
will execute. If this condition is false,

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1604-2
00:34:17.264 --> 00:34:21.414
it will go and check the next condition.
If that is also false,

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1604-3
00:34:21.414 --> 00:34:24.526
it will go to the next.
If none of these match,

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1604-4
00:34:24.526 --> 00:34:26.796
it will go to the else part, right?

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1620-0
00:34:27.956 --> 00:34:32.283
So in that case we can use the LC.
If you'll use LC if it,

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1620-1
00:34:32.283 --> 00:34:37.563
but then this LC part will go,
it's important and that's why we have to

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1620-2
00:34:37.563 --> 00:34:38.076
use LC.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1629-0
00:35:02.436 --> 00:35:20.076
What did you?

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1631-0
00:35:21.836 --> 00:35:33.476
That is 5 options.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1645-0
00:36:12.116 --> 00:36:28.116
And then what happens?

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1646-0
00:36:36.996 --> 00:36:40.476
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1648-0
00:36:45.036 --> 00:36:46.676
Then we don't.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1650-0
00:36:48.276 --> 00:36:50.596
Thank you.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1654-0
00:37:09.996 --> 00:37:11.676
I love you too.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1655-0
00:37:14.036 --> 00:37:23.316
It's like any kind of a project to check
in this, you know?

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1660-0
00:37:28.916 --> 00:37:45.516
I'm sorry.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1662-0
00:37:45.996 --> 00:37:53.236
When I take the day, see, that's right,
just when I take the day.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1667-0
00:38:11.156 --> 00:38:16.196
That's it.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1673-0
00:38:42.636 --> 00:38:56.316
We'll do that.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1684-0
00:38:58.036 --> 00:39:17.556
It's actually a.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1688-0
00:39:20.996 --> 00:39:25.076
Oh, society.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1692-0
00:40:01.476 --> 00:40:10.436
Versions of the.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1711-0
00:40:43.076 --> 00:40:55.460
You'll be like I'll see, I'll see.
I'll see if you want to do the withdrawal,

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1711-1
00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:58.636
you have to run the.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1724-0
00:40:58.996 --> 00:41:09.196
You want to use the while loop in this
one. How to do it?

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1734-0
00:41:10.716 --> 00:41:15.707
Everything I will do.
What you will do then that you will do.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1734-1
00:41:15.707 --> 00:41:17.156
This is your task.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1746-0
00:42:01.676 --> 00:42:21.076
I don't. I think you don't.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1778-0
00:42:24.716 --> 00:42:30.669
So let's just start the next thing now.
Python. OK,

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1778-1
00:42:30.669 --> 00:42:34.676
this one I have not uploaded today.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1780-0
00:42:43.836 --> 00:42:44.676
Let me upload it fast.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1781-0
00:42:50.876 --> 00:42:52.636
Yeah.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1785-0
00:43:13.316 --> 00:43:14.636
Is that.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1786-0
00:43:17.556 --> 00:43:20.716
Can you?

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1787-0
00:43:22.076 --> 00:43:26.036
OK, I'll check that.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1802-0
00:43:32.876 --> 00:43:43.918
Let me just upload it for today's content,
then we'll start the next thing.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1802-1
00:43:43.918 --> 00:43:45.516
So here is.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1817-0
00:44:10.436 --> 00:44:21.796
Should I start new Tawik now?
You are all set already. Let's start.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1835-0
00:44:25.516 --> 00:44:31.412
Today I will give you some exercises so I
can share today on WhatsApp so you can

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1835-1
00:44:31.412 --> 00:44:34.396
submit your responses before the morning.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1837-0
00:44:36.436 --> 00:44:37.236
OK, is it fine?

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1840-0
00:44:41.236 --> 00:44:43.836
When not today? Tomorrow.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1841-0
00:44:46.996 --> 00:44:47.476
Mhm.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1844-0
00:45:10.716 --> 00:45:25.516
I think that should do it.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1852-0
00:45:25.676 --> 00:45:40.436
It's the same text.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1866-0
00:45:56.756 --> 00:46:03.956
We should put a.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1868-0
00:46:19.396 --> 00:46:19.436
Oh.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1883-0
00:46:24.996 --> 00:46:38.436
I have here.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1889-0
00:46:39.076 --> 00:46:49.156
Should it be?

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1892-0
00:46:52.076 --> 00:46:53.396
I do think that it.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1893-0
00:46:59.196 --> 00:46:59.796
Yeah.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1894-0
00:47:03.956 --> 00:47:04.116
Oops.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1905-0
00:47:05.196 --> 00:47:22.236
That's OK.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1913-0
00:47:22.436 --> 00:47:27.476
I'm not.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1923-0
00:47:34.516 --> 00:47:51.276
Well, it's guess you want.
I'm speaking and you know, you know.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1943-0
00:47:51.476 --> 00:47:59.908
See,
I have uploaded this one and this is the

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1943-1
00:47:59.908 --> 00:48:08.156
PDF also.
That's the PDF for the next topic.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1944-0
00:48:16.236 --> 00:48:16.436
Ready.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1945-0
00:48:22.356 --> 00:48:22.596
Yes.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1961-0
00:48:27.516 --> 00:48:33.814
Changed, right? What? Sorry,
that's really the bad ones.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1961-1
00:48:33.814 --> 00:48:40.996
That's great balance and what we can
change through the methods.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1964-0
00:48:44.716 --> 00:48:46.836
To the matters we can change.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/1966-0
00:48:52.276 --> 00:48:54.396
This court.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/2003-0
00:49:01.676 --> 00:49:05.958
Yeah, this one. Yeah,
that that that language.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/2003-1
00:49:05.958 --> 00:49:11.607
This is the keyword. This is the keyword.
This is a function.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/2003-2
00:49:11.607 --> 00:49:18.258
Actually this is initializer in the
morning. We are done. Actually I am,

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/2003-3
00:49:18.258 --> 00:49:21.356
but we have not returned the time.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/2044-0
00:49:21.676 --> 00:49:26.217
This is the initializer.
This is a function that's automatically

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/2044-1
00:49:26.217 --> 00:49:30.548
call whenever you will create the object
of this class right?

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/2044-2
00:49:30.548 --> 00:49:35.019
So for example you have created the
object here AC account Sam.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/2044-3
00:49:35.019 --> 00:49:40.608
So this init will call so holder name
will be it set the Sam and the balance it

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/2044-4
00:49:40.608 --> 00:49:41.516
will set the.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/2056-0
00:49:41.596 --> 00:49:46.312
You values you have passed.
For example you have created one more.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/2056-1
00:49:46.312 --> 00:49:48.916
Let's say AC one is equal to account.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/2069-0
00:49:50.676 --> 00:49:57.427
And you have rate from here this is 1 Raj
for example and here you have rate some

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/2069-1
00:49:57.427 --> 00:49:59.156
sort of amount right?

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/2071-0
00:50:05.276 --> 00:50:05.556
