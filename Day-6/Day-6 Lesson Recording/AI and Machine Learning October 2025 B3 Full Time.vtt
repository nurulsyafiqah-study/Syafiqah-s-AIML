1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/190-0
00:30:11.737 --> 00:30:12.257
Yes.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/191-0
00:30:17.897 --> 00:30:21.737
Hi, good morning.
I'm going to start the session now.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/192-0
00:30:24.417 --> 00:30:26.057
Hope everyone is here now.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/193-0
00:30:32.657 --> 00:30:34.097
Good morning, Sir.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/194-0
00:30:34.257 --> 00:30:35.177
Good morning.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/195-0
00:30:45.377 --> 00:30:47.217
Let me share my screen.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/196-0
00:30:49.737 --> 00:30:53.017
We were discussing about the Uh classes.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/198-0
00:31:05.217 --> 00:31:07.177
Let's continue that discussion.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/199-0
00:31:10.657 --> 00:31:13.777
The file file I already have shared with
you guys, right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/200-0
00:31:17.537 --> 00:31:19.977
Object oriented programming.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/201-0
00:31:26.537 --> 00:31:30.623
So what is object-oriented programming?
How to define a class,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/201-1
00:31:30.623 --> 00:31:34.514
creating the object methods in a class,
object constructor,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/201-2
00:31:34.514 --> 00:31:37.497
hands-on labs and assessment quiz at the
end.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/202-0
00:31:41.257 --> 00:31:46.925
So what is object oriented programming?
Theoretically I already told you we are

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/202-1
00:31:46.925 --> 00:31:50.821
think about the objects, right?
Not the functionality.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/202-2
00:31:50.821 --> 00:31:55.002
We will think about the objects and
depend on the objects.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/202-3
00:31:55.002 --> 00:31:59.819
We will create our programs.
For example you are going to develop a

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/202-4
00:31:59.819 --> 00:32:00.457
employee.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/203-0
00:32:00.777 --> 00:32:06.535
Management system. So what you will do,
you will think about the employees and

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/203-1
00:32:06.535 --> 00:32:12.002
then employee have some certain
characteristic. They have some sort of ID,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/203-2
00:32:12.002 --> 00:32:17.614
they have name and qualification and then
you have some sort of methods what

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/203-3
00:32:17.614 --> 00:32:20.457
employees doing, registration, display.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/204-0
00:32:21.937 --> 00:32:22.657
A lot so.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/205-0
00:32:24.217 --> 00:32:29.698
The similar sort of things we will put
together that is known as a class and

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/205-1
00:32:29.698 --> 00:32:35.607
then we will create a real time entity of
the class. For example you will say car.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/205-2
00:32:35.607 --> 00:32:39.879
So car is a class.
Then you are going to create a real time

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/205-3
00:32:39.879 --> 00:32:40.377
entity.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/208-0
00:32:41.697 --> 00:32:46.578
Proton anything you are going to create
that is this one.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/208-1
00:32:46.578 --> 00:32:51.291
The object that is the real time example
of that thing.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/208-2
00:32:51.291 --> 00:32:57.435
For example you have created the employee.
Employee is a blue blueprint.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/208-3
00:32:57.435 --> 00:33:00.297
It's a blueprint employee have ID.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/209-0
00:33:00.857 --> 00:33:06.190
It's have a name and doing certain task.
Then you have created one employee.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/209-1
00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:09.375
For example you have created let's say
Ajmal.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/209-2
00:33:09.375 --> 00:33:13.669
So Ajmal have an ID 01 and he has some
sort of qualification.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/209-3
00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:17.617
So the Ajmal is the real time entity of
employee, right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/252-0
00:33:38.586 --> 00:33:43.813
That will call automatically whenever you
will create the object of the class.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/252-1
00:33:43.813 --> 00:33:48.642
The constructor is a special kind of
method that is called automatically

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/252-2
00:33:48.642 --> 00:33:52.149
whenever you will create the object of
class, right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/252-3
00:33:52.149 --> 00:33:55.986
So let's see one example of how we will
define the class.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/298-0
00:33:57.426 --> 00:34:01.469
So as I already told you,
a class is a blueprint for creating the

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/298-1
00:34:01.469 --> 00:34:04.470
object. It's a template,
it's an object factory,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/298-2
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:08.145
anything you can see right?
So how we will write the class?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/298-3
00:34:08.145 --> 00:34:10.901
We will write the class.
Class is a keyword.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/298-4
00:34:10.901 --> 00:34:15.066
Then after that we will write the class
name and inside this class.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/330-0
00:34:15.626 --> 00:34:20.431
We will let all the class attributes.
We will let the functionality,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/330-1
00:34:20.431 --> 00:34:25.864
we will let the method. For example,
you want to use the ID name and you want

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/330-2
00:34:25.864 --> 00:34:31.226
to do some sort of method display
register so you can write inside that one.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/348-0
00:34:31.226 --> 00:34:35.185
Here is one example.
You have created a car and the car is

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/348-1
00:34:35.185 --> 00:34:40.688
defining. You have defined a method start.
Whenever you will create the object of

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/348-2
00:34:40.688 --> 00:34:43.506
the car, you can access this method start.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/351-0
00:34:49.306 --> 00:34:50.906
So that uh.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/362-0
00:34:51.946 --> 00:34:58.066
Initial example of class we already have
seen. Let's discuss about the constructor.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/408-0
00:35:01.026 --> 00:35:06.227
So constructor, what is constructor?
Constructor is a special kind of method

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/408-1
00:35:06.227 --> 00:35:11.563
that is called automatically whenever you
will create the object of the class.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/408-2
00:35:11.563 --> 00:35:16.494
So how we will write the constructor we
will write here init initialize.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/408-3
00:35:16.494 --> 00:35:20.546
This is short form of initialization.
So we will write the.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/456-0
00:35:20.706 --> 00:35:24.758
Under score, under score, init,
under score, under score.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/456-1
00:35:24.758 --> 00:35:30.067
Then we will write this parenthesis small
bracket that is your constructor.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/456-2
00:35:30.067 --> 00:35:33.909
Whenever we'll see this init that is your
constructor.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/456-3
00:35:33.909 --> 00:35:39.079
So initially once you are going to
construct all kind of object that time

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/456-4
00:35:39.079 --> 00:35:40.266
you will use the.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/501-0
00:35:40.346 --> 00:35:43.721
A constructor.
So this method you need not to call.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/501-1
00:35:43.721 --> 00:35:48.978
It is called automatically. For example,
here we have create a class student and

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/501-2
00:35:48.978 --> 00:35:52.352
inside this student we have write the
name and age.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/501-3
00:35:52.352 --> 00:35:57.609
So whenever you will create the object of
this class it is automatically called.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/501-4
00:35:57.609 --> 00:35:59.426
Let me show you practically.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/538-0
00:35:59.786 --> 00:36:03.652
So what we will do this is day number six,
right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/538-1
00:36:03.652 --> 00:36:10.068
So we'll create the folder for day number
six. So here you will go to your folder.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/538-2
00:36:10.068 --> 00:36:15.866
This is your folder AIML and you will go
create one subfolder inside that.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/538-3
00:36:15.866 --> 00:36:17.026
That is day #6.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/544-0
00:36:17.386 --> 00:36:22.586
Right click here new folder and folder
name is DA 6.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/545-0
00:36:24.706 --> 00:36:24.946
Right.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/596-0
00:36:27.346 --> 00:36:30.611
And we will start with the constructor
example.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/596-1
00:36:30.611 --> 00:36:34.420
So you right click here and you can open
it in VS code.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/596-2
00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:37.480
So more options from here open with VS
code.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/596-3
00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:42.921
If you are not able to see that options
here so you can directly open using the

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/596-4
00:36:42.921 --> 00:36:46.186
VS code also you already know right?
So I will.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/605-0
00:36:46.386 --> 00:36:51.584
Directly open from the Visual Studio code.
You will go to the Visual Studio code

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/605-1
00:36:51.584 --> 00:36:52.226
from here.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/607-0
00:36:53.506 --> 00:36:54.026
And.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/645-0
00:36:55.306 --> 00:36:59.461
You will go here,
find open folder and you will go to that

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/645-1
00:36:59.461 --> 00:37:04.461
location that is AIML day six.
Select the folder and you can open this

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/645-2
00:37:04.461 --> 00:37:08.898
way. It's up to you.
Whatever the way is comfortable with you,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/645-3
00:37:08.898 --> 00:37:13.546
you can use done up to this level.
All of you online one as well.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/650-0
00:37:13.666 --> 00:37:18.186
So right click here we are going to
create a new for example.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/652-0
00:37:19.786 --> 00:37:21.146
This is.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/664-0
00:37:22.426 --> 00:37:29.346
Object oriented programming OOB example
one I have given the name dot py.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/705-0
00:37:30.346 --> 00:37:36.019
Or simply, let's say example one dot py,
the day six example number one dot py,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/705-1
00:37:36.019 --> 00:37:40.273
right? We are going to create a class.
To create the class,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/705-2
00:37:40.273 --> 00:37:44.882
we will let class is a keyword.
Then we will let the class name.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/705-3
00:37:44.882 --> 00:37:48.641
For example,
you are going to create a class player,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/705-4
00:37:48.641 --> 00:37:49.066
right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/711-0
00:37:49.306 --> 00:37:54.546
Player and enter.
Here you are going to define.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/714-0
00:37:58.106 --> 00:37:59.946
Define the in need.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/720-0
00:38:02.866 --> 00:38:06.466
Init and we want to declare here.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/724-0
00:38:07.786 --> 00:38:10.386
Let's say I have right here print.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/732-0
00:38:13.626 --> 00:38:20.746
Welcome to player class.
Just to show you that player class.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/755-0
00:38:24.026 --> 00:38:29.282
And this class we have created.
This is how we'll create the class, right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/755-1
00:38:29.282 --> 00:38:33.626
Just a constructor, no method,
nothing here, right? And here.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/777-0
00:38:35.386 --> 00:38:40.966
I'm going to create the object of the
class. So create the object of the class.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/777-1
00:38:40.966 --> 00:38:46.546
The syntax is we will write the object
name. Let me write here object creation.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/782-0
00:38:47.946 --> 00:38:51.186
This is objective issue we are going to
write here.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/792-0
00:38:52.266 --> 00:38:58.946
Let's say P1 or player one.
Let's say P1 is equal to player.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/798-0
00:39:01.786 --> 00:39:05.546
We have just tried this one and we want
to.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/817-0
00:39:07.226 --> 00:39:11.927
We have done this one only, right?
We have not tried anything,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/817-1
00:39:11.927 --> 00:39:17.149
we have not call any method,
just we have create the object and we'll

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/817-2
00:39:17.149 --> 00:39:17.746
go here.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/820-0
00:39:20.346 --> 00:39:22.986
We will like from here Python.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/823-0
00:39:24.626 --> 00:39:26.706
Example one dot py.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/842-0
00:39:28.506 --> 00:39:32.909
Welcome to player class.
So you'll see we have just created the

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/842-1
00:39:32.909 --> 00:39:37.106
object and it's automatically called the
this method, right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/864-0
00:39:41.466 --> 00:39:45.490
It's fine. It is your your.
Spencer is perfectly fine.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/864-1
00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:49.367
There's no problem with it.
Even before we complain,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/864-2
00:39:49.367 --> 00:39:55.438
there's no problem. We'll start an update.
I think once again we'll check anything

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/864-3
00:39:55.438 --> 00:39:57.706
with nothing. So we can use it.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/879-0
00:39:57.906 --> 00:40:01.713
OK, no, I need. Sorry you someone,
for example,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/879-1
00:40:01.713 --> 00:40:07.186
you said the money that you know about
the the class, right? OK, so.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/907-0
00:40:08.906 --> 00:40:11.841
What is? What is it so far?
Just what this is?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/907-1
00:40:11.841 --> 00:40:17.087
Salman started explaining about the class.
Are you connecting with the concept plus

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/907-2
00:40:17.087 --> 00:40:20.771
what? What is the?
What do you think is the purpose of the

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/907-3
00:40:20.771 --> 00:40:23.706
class?
You you tend to make sense of the play?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/917-0
00:40:24.586 --> 00:40:31.110
But can you just explain in your words
why? Why do you need classes in in Python?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/917-1
00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:31.826
Any idea?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/928-0
00:40:33.466 --> 00:40:37.214
And you wonder what that you think you
don't have to be exactly right or it

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/928-1
00:40:37.214 --> 00:40:38.546
doesn't, it doesn't matter.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/935-0
00:40:40.146 --> 00:40:44.106
Where do you think that we should use
passes the purpose?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/947-0
00:40:48.186 --> 00:40:56.506
How are you? Me. Yeah. Hey, the game.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/951-0
00:40:58.426 --> 00:41:04.146
We give comment to the completed in one
in one.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/977-0
00:41:05.546 --> 00:41:11.889
And then not the common class. Yeah,
class. What is the purpose? Now, Mr.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/977-1
00:41:11.889 --> 00:41:15.918
Salman is teaching the class, right? Yeah,
OK,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/977-2
00:41:15.918 --> 00:41:20.546
we can record the class again and again.
We can call.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/979-0
00:41:20.986 --> 00:41:21.346
Yeah.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/980-0
00:41:23.226 --> 00:41:23.346
OK.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/982-0
00:41:27.426 --> 00:41:27.946
Miss you.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/984-0
00:41:36.386 --> 00:41:37.226
Similar.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/989-0
00:41:38.186 --> 00:41:41.986
A similar character think something like
that, yes.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1015-0
00:41:43.226 --> 00:41:49.594
Then it's the one. It's the a bit fine,
but think see, like you know,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1015-1
00:41:49.594 --> 00:41:56.599
you know the plain English, right?
In English you have heard about the noun,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1015-2
00:41:56.599 --> 00:41:59.146
right? What is noun? Anyone.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1055-0
00:41:59.266 --> 00:42:04.722
Noun in English noun, you know person,
place or thing is noun, right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1055-1
00:42:04.722 --> 00:42:08.930
Similarly here in Python or any
programming language,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1055-2
00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:14.464
the class is a count kind of noun.
You see the person, place or thing,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1055-3
00:42:14.464 --> 00:42:18.906
any entity you are creating that class
the class have a.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1098-0
00:42:18.986 --> 00:42:22.460
Sense of attributes and functionality
right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1098-1
00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:28.404
Like you say the in the noun you say
person. So person is a just a template.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1098-2
00:42:28.404 --> 00:42:34.656
It's not a actual person. For example Mr.
Wahid is here. So he is actual person.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1098-3
00:42:34.656 --> 00:42:36.586
He is a an object of the.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1155-0
00:42:36.786 --> 00:42:41.601
Class, right? So class is a blueprint.
It's a template of the things I told you

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1155-1
00:42:41.601 --> 00:42:45.814
in the last session. For example,
you are using these laptops, right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1155-2
00:42:45.814 --> 00:42:49.966
You are using the Dell, you are using Mac.
So these are all laptops,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1155-3
00:42:49.966 --> 00:42:53.156
but they have the different kind of
characteristics.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1155-4
00:42:53.156 --> 00:42:56.466
Every laptop have a different kind of
characteristics.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1206-0
00:42:56.586 --> 00:43:00.960
Once we will create the template,
the blueprint right after that we can

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1206-1
00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:03.876
create the instance of that thing.
For example,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1206-2
00:43:03.876 --> 00:43:07.157
you have to manage the employees in our
organization.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1206-3
00:43:07.157 --> 00:43:11.531
So we will not create the separate
separate, we'll create the template.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1206-4
00:43:11.531 --> 00:43:16.026
In the template we will there will be one
ID, 1 qualification, one short.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1252-0
00:43:16.106 --> 00:43:20.325
Of job he is doing or she is doing.
So those characteristics we will lay

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1252-1
00:43:20.325 --> 00:43:23.735
inside the class.
Whenever we need to create the real time

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1252-2
00:43:23.735 --> 00:43:26.566
entity,
we will create the object of that class,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1252-3
00:43:26.566 --> 00:43:31.363
right? So if someone asks what is class?
So class is a template, it's a blueprint,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1252-4
00:43:31.363 --> 00:43:35.466
it's a collection of the things.
We will wrap all the things together.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1263-0
00:43:35.586 --> 00:43:40.682
Together and whenever we required,
we can create the real time entity for

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1263-1
00:43:40.682 --> 00:43:42.266
that thing. Got it? OK.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1299-0
00:43:43.906 --> 00:43:48.590
I'm not from my programming,
but I'm like you guys, OK?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1299-1
00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:54.862
I'm from my networking, security,
that's my area of expertise. So what Mr.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1299-2
00:43:54.862 --> 00:43:59.546
Salman explained. OK,
it's a I'm taking your sight, OK?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1304-0
00:43:59.906 --> 00:44:04.026
So it's it's a for me also a big sounds
like a uh.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1348-0
00:44:05.186 --> 00:44:09.435
I take time to think a little bit.
I have to think about it and then I try

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1348-1
00:44:09.435 --> 00:44:14.138
to make sense out of it to understand in
the relevance of what we're learning. OK,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1348-2
00:44:14.138 --> 00:44:18.840
in the in Python, we're learning Python.
So where exactly am I going to apply this

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1348-3
00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:23.146
class or object or oops concept,
like object oriented programming concepts?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1378-0
00:44:23.866 --> 00:44:28.653
Where exactly I have to apply it.
So for me, if I'm one of you,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1378-1
00:44:28.653 --> 00:44:33.589
I will ask Mr. Salman,
can you show me some maybe a diagrammatic,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1378-2
00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:37.328
some sort of a, you know,
a picture or a mapping,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1378-3
00:44:37.328 --> 00:44:39.946
how exactly I can visualize better?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1393-0
00:44:40.586 --> 00:44:46.351
The class structure. OK, so Miss Amman,
do you have any such a diagram you can

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1393-1
00:44:46.351 --> 00:44:51.386
you can show? At least I can also see.
Sure. So please, please show.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1420-0
00:44:54.386 --> 00:44:59.307
So I'm expecting you all to ask the
questions like what I'm trying to ask.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1420-1
00:44:59.307 --> 00:45:03.506
I'm I'm not from programming background
as well, so he's asked.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1460-0
00:45:04.826 --> 00:45:08.355
Explanation.
He explains in the way best possible from

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1460-1
00:45:08.355 --> 00:45:12.333
his point of view. But as a student,
from your point of view,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1460-2
00:45:12.333 --> 00:45:16.504
you must try to ask question in the best
way that you can learn.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1460-3
00:45:16.504 --> 00:45:20.546
So both have to take advantage of each
other. So if you don't.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1472-0
00:45:21.026 --> 00:45:24.300
You know,
use his expertise for your understanding

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1472-1
00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:28.666
and then then it it will not be a proper
learning. So ask interact.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1520-0
00:45:30.386 --> 00:45:33.708
Instead of, you know,
just keeping with yourself,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1520-1
00:45:33.708 --> 00:45:36.698
there is no such thing as a simple
question.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1520-2
00:45:36.698 --> 00:45:41.814
There is no such thing as a dumb question.
No such thing. Please ask me. OK,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1520-3
00:45:41.814 --> 00:45:46.133
I ask him a diagram. Mr. Salamat,
do you have any contender? No,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1520-4
00:45:46.133 --> 00:45:50.186
the diagram is at such is a no.
Make them understand better.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1558-0
00:45:50.386 --> 00:45:54.277
How to visualize the class structure? Yes,
absolutely. Yeah,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1558-1
00:45:54.277 --> 00:45:59.317
that that will help me as well. See,
for example, you are going to create all,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1558-2
00:45:59.317 --> 00:46:03.591
you know, the car, dogs, animals,
you know, right? So for example,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1558-3
00:46:03.591 --> 00:46:07.801
you have a car, right?
So the car has some sort of functionality.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1558-4
00:46:07.801 --> 00:46:09.906
So this is again the text, right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1562-0
00:46:09.986 --> 00:46:15.786
Visual. No, we will.
That's mobile and sync. Fine. No issue.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1566-0
00:46:18.226 --> 00:46:19.866
Visually you want to see OK.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1574-0
00:46:27.026 --> 00:46:34.026
It's fine. It's totally fine. It's good.
At least.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1576-0
00:46:44.626 --> 00:46:47.266
Quick, for example.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1580-0
00:46:55.386 --> 00:47:00.546
Three, three wise. Uh, login need.
I'll be like, I have uh with you space.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1581-0
00:47:01.506 --> 00:47:01.626
OK.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1627-0
00:47:03.346 --> 00:47:07.093
This is all Mike. Yes, and me.
Just to be friendly,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1627-1
00:47:07.093 --> 00:47:13.003
actually I was really lost from the first
chapter up till now and I just give you

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1627-2
00:47:13.003 --> 00:47:17.975
the view. Just a few minutes.
I didn't get the idea actually because

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1627-3
00:47:17.975 --> 00:47:21.146
see this one is the the class.
This is the.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1671-0
00:47:21.266 --> 00:47:26.451
The row row concept, right?
So this is the you have created the class.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1671-1
00:47:26.451 --> 00:47:29.810
So class have some sort of properties,
right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1671-2
00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:35.725
You have the some sort of color will be
there, some sort of price will be there,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1671-3
00:47:35.725 --> 00:47:40.106
some sort of miles he can cover model.
So this is the just.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1718-0
00:47:40.626 --> 00:47:45.587
Blank idea in your mind what you are
going to do that is the abstract idea.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1718-1
00:47:45.587 --> 00:47:49.242
It's going to forward,
it's going to backwards and all.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1718-2
00:47:49.242 --> 00:47:54.398
Once you go you will create the real time
entity. This is the real time class.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1718-3
00:47:54.398 --> 00:47:58.837
So here it's have some sort of color,
it's have some sort of price.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1718-4
00:47:58.837 --> 00:47:59.946
Here is how much.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1734-0
00:48:00.626 --> 00:48:05.410
Kilometer here the model start backward,
forward. This is the real time.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1734-1
00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:09.472
This is the template.
This is the blank thing and this is the

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1734-2
00:48:09.472 --> 00:48:10.586
real time entity.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1749-0
00:48:12.946 --> 00:48:17.897
But you are programmer.
You need not to go to that one.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1749-1
00:48:17.897 --> 00:48:21.786
That's very it's basic thing.
Let him come.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1751-0
00:48:25.506 --> 00:48:26.306
You got it now.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1758-0
00:48:34.946 --> 00:48:36.906
Let me copy it and put it here.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1761-0
00:48:53.106 --> 00:48:53.186
It.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1762-0
00:48:55.626 --> 00:48:55.786
And.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1763-0
00:48:57.626 --> 00:48:58.426
It's.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1765-0
00:49:00.826 --> 00:49:17.066
Let me put it here.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1783-0
00:49:25.386 --> 00:49:30.746
Yeah, yeah.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1791-0
00:49:38.586 --> 00:49:50.506
I can't understand.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1802-0
00:49:52.066 --> 00:49:58.826
Sorry for the interruption.
So this is the one image I'll put here.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1849-0
00:50:00.466 --> 00:50:05.750
See, this is the template, right?
So this time we don't have the actual

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1849-1
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:11.180
thing. We have the idea in our mind,
right? We are going to create a car.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1849-2
00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:16.757
So the car should have some sort of color.
It must have some sort of price.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1849-3
00:50:16.757 --> 00:50:19.986
It must go some sort of kilometers and
all.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1886-0
00:50:19.986 --> 00:50:23.883
And there will be one model.
It can have the functionality,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1886-1
00:50:23.883 --> 00:50:29.275
it can start, it can go to the backward,
forward and all. So this is the template,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1886-2
00:50:29.275 --> 00:50:33.107
this is the class.
Now you are going to create a real time

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1886-3
00:50:33.107 --> 00:50:34.666
entity, the real object.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1926-0
00:50:35.026 --> 00:50:38.334
One car,
one car you are going to create that is

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1926-1
00:50:38.334 --> 00:50:42.519
have a color, let's say red.
Then it have some sort of price.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1926-2
00:50:42.519 --> 00:50:46.029
It has some sort of the destination it's
can cover.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1926-3
00:50:46.029 --> 00:50:49.944
It's some sort of model it have and these
are the things.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1926-4
00:50:49.944 --> 00:50:54.466
There's another car from the same
template you can create another.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1951-0
00:50:54.906 --> 00:51:00.642
Card with the color of let's say green or
the blue color or silver or anything and

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1951-1
00:51:00.642 --> 00:51:06.033
it should make have the different sort of
prices. Thank you Sir. OK, you Sir,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1951-2
00:51:06.033 --> 00:51:07.346
does it make sense?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1982-0
00:51:08.786 --> 00:51:13.875
You understand better, right? OK,
this what? What? What? What did Mr.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1982-1
00:51:13.875 --> 00:51:19.690
Salman did now? He went to Google, right?
He tried to find using some sentence,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/1982-2
00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:25.506
some phrase he used. OK, what's the class?
Oops in the in the graphical format.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2004-0
00:51:25.746 --> 00:51:30.159
He used that to find some videos.
I mean that there's some sort of a

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2004-1
00:51:30.159 --> 00:51:34.700
graphical explanation and he watched it
and it is making sense, right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2004-2
00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:37.066
It's you can visualize better, right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2015-0
00:51:38.946 --> 00:51:41.624
You want him to do the all the training
in this way.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2015-1
00:51:41.624 --> 00:51:43.746
It's taking it's going to take six months.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2031-0
00:51:46.346 --> 00:51:50.426
Is going to take a long time.
So my advice to you, my dear friends,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2031-1
00:51:50.426 --> 00:51:52.106
you need to do this at home.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2072-0
00:51:55.066 --> 00:51:58.596
Because if you go this way,
it still will take too long.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2072-1
00:51:58.596 --> 00:52:02.559
So but if you can help him by preparing
extra spending at home,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2072-2
00:52:02.559 --> 00:52:07.142
you can learn more because he can use his
expertise to learn more things.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2072-3
00:52:07.142 --> 00:52:11.786
But by helping to prepare fundamentals,
everything at home, do extra work.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2103-0
00:52:12.066 --> 00:52:15.996
These 30 days,
give yourself these 30 days. Do more work,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2103-1
00:52:15.996 --> 00:52:19.791
spend more time. OK, tomorrow's topics.
Ask Mr. Salman.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2103-2
00:52:19.791 --> 00:52:25.482
He will tell you and then do some reading
about it. Next day, by the time you come,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2103-3
00:52:25.482 --> 00:52:27.786
it will not be a surprise for you.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2131-0
00:52:28.386 --> 00:52:32.854
So this is a problem of a prerequisite or
no ID learning in the past.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2131-1
00:52:32.854 --> 00:52:36.557
But the only way you can address it by
reading, watching,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2131-2
00:52:36.557 --> 00:52:40.195
doing more and more something about it on
a daily basis.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2131-3
00:52:40.195 --> 00:52:43.706
Then only your your mind will become IT
thinking mind.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2168-0
00:52:44.026 --> 00:52:47.452
So you do that 100% you will see a good
results. OK,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2168-1
00:52:47.452 --> 00:52:52.041
so that's my this is not actually
practically I wanted to demonstrate.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2168-2
00:52:52.041 --> 00:52:57.018
That's why I disturb your class so that
you know you can learn more by doing

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2168-3
00:52:57.018 --> 00:53:01.026
extra work at home.
We just have to go and find you know more

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2168-4
00:53:01.026 --> 00:53:01.866
explanations.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2199-0
00:53:02.226 --> 00:53:07.081
More ways of, you know,
understanding better. How can you do that?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2199-1
00:53:07.081 --> 00:53:11.212
You tomorrow's topics.
You get a list of topics from Mr.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2199-2
00:53:11.212 --> 00:53:17.226
Salman that night before you come to the
class. Do your homework and you do it OK.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2232-0
00:53:17.626 --> 00:53:21.535
So I hope this helps.
Sorry for the encryption. It's OK,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2232-1
00:53:21.535 --> 00:53:25.100
it's good.
Maybe if there's someone can say that BS

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2232-2
00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:29.558
file, not the example. Mm-hmm.
I I will do. I will do that also.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2232-3
00:53:29.558 --> 00:53:34.906
That's fine and that that's also fine.
Yeah, I can. I can put in advance one.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2243-0
00:53:35.226 --> 00:53:41.170
It's OK. If you want it earlier,
I can do that also. OK, so please begin.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2243-1
00:53:41.170 --> 00:53:45.266
Yeah, fine. Thank you. OK, Mr. Meet,
I think it's.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2244-0
00:53:45.306 --> 00:53:45.386
It.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2246-0
00:53:46.666 --> 00:53:52.386
So this I think it was.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2277-0
00:54:21.066 --> 00:54:29.466
I think I by mistake I have given him the
apartment key. Why would I?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2277-1
00:54:29.466 --> 00:54:37.746
Can I please check the apartment key I
have given to you by mistake.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2290-0
00:54:37.946 --> 00:54:45.546
I don't know,
but it's anyway so then so this one is we

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2290-1
00:54:45.546 --> 00:54:49.346
will write here the example.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2293-0
00:54:50.746 --> 00:54:52.746
So what happened is.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2317-0
00:54:54.986 --> 00:54:59.639
We have defined this is the constructor.
It's automatically create this thing

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2317-1
00:54:59.639 --> 00:55:02.384
right?
So now we are going to create a method

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2317-2
00:55:02.384 --> 00:55:05.426
done up to this level.
This one you have not done.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2324-0
00:55:29.946 --> 00:55:33.466
Let's create one method define.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2326-0
00:55:34.226 --> 00:55:35.706
Register.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2328-0

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2719-1
01:07:47.459 --> 01:07:51.281
it's called automatically whenever you
create the object, right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2719-2
01:07:51.281 --> 01:07:54.926
So it's calling three times.
Then the ID name you have stored

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2719-3
01:07:54.926 --> 01:07:58.277

So you can use it using the constructor

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2719-4
01:07:58.277 --> 01:08:00.746
as well that is parameterized constructor.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2723-0
01:08:01.666 --> 01:08:04.226

01:08:13.946 --> 01:08:19.127
I have copy this control C if I will use
it without the this one without

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2754-1
01:08:19.127 --> 01:08:22.818
constructor,
without this register method using the

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2754-2
01:08:22.818 --> 01:08:25.586
constructor. How we'll do it? See here.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2756-0

01:08:32.826 --> 01:08:36.358
If you want to use the parameterize
constructor,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2771-1
01:08:36.358 --> 01:08:40.106
this is next example I'm going to use
parameterize.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2775-0
01:08:42.946 --> 01:08:45.226
What happened to this machine?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2779-0
01:08:47.426 --> 01:08:48.906
Where am I traced?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2781-0
01:08:50.946 --> 01:08:51.586
Constructor.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2784-0
01:08:58.866 --> 01:09:00.226
So here it is. Uh.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2789-0
01:09:01.426 --> 01:09:04.226
We want to take it from here.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2794-0
01:09:08.986 --> 01:09:12.266
I have right here self.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2795-0
01:09:15.266 --> 01:09:15.626
ID.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2803-0
01:09:19.306 --> 01:09:22.306
We just delete all these things,
so here's the self.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2835-0
01:09:24.946 --> 01:09:28.966
ID name.
These things we want to take through the

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2835-1
01:09:28.966 --> 01:09:35.318
parameter through the constructor only ID
name and one more thing we have team

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2835-2
01:09:35.318 --> 01:09:40.786
right? Three things we have ID name, team.
So we have it here self.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2847-0
01:09:41.226 --> 01:09:52.346
dot ID is equal to ID self dot name is
equal to name then self dot.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2854-0
01:09:53.226 --> 01:09:59.546
What else? P is equal to P fine.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2900-0
01:10:03.106 --> 01:10:08.721
So now how you'll create the object?
This time if you'll create the object

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2900-1
01:10:08.721 --> 01:10:15.084
player, you have created the first object,
let's say P1P1 is equal to P1 is equal to

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2900-2
01:10:15.084 --> 01:10:18.678
player.
So you want to create the object of the

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2900-3
01:10:18.678 --> 01:10:22.346
player.
So from here you have to pass this time.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2906-0
01:10:22.466 --> 01:10:27.266
The ID name and team from here.
So ID one name is let's say.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2910-0
01:10:29.706 --> 01:10:31.506
I'm writing the same.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2918-0
01:10:43.426 --> 01:10:45.506
So would we have passed through the?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2928-0
01:10:46.426 --> 01:10:49.713
Register method.
This time we are passing through the

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2928-1
01:10:49.713 --> 01:10:50.626
constructor OK.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2939-0
01:10:53.386 --> 01:10:59.316
ID name.
Similarly we have created P2 is equal to

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2939-1
01:10:59.316 --> 01:11:00.146
player.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2948-0
01:11:02.306 --> 01:11:05.506
We have right here too.
We have right here. Let's see.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2951-0
01:11:08.026 --> 01:11:10.186
And here we have right.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2970-0
01:11:12.506 --> 01:11:20.394
We have rate one more E3 is equal to
player. We have rate three.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2970-1
01:11:20.394 --> 01:11:26.826
We have rate this one and we have rate
here England.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2981-0
01:11:29.266 --> 01:11:34.706
We have created 3-4 as many as you want.
You can create, you can display here.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/2982-0
01:11:36.306 --> 01:11:36.386

Yeah, sure.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3056-0
01:14:01.866 --> 01:14:08.226
We have read the P1 register. OK,
go to the line #10.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3061-0
01:14:12.506 --> 01:14:16.786
Line #10.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3065-0
01:14:17.146 --> 01:14:19.426
Did you have a P display?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3078-0
01:14:22.426 --> 01:14:27.386
Um, I think here is. It's not blue.
I don't know why.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3079-0
01:14:27.986 --> 01:14:30.546
The go to the line #5 first.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3095-0
01:14:33.226 --> 01:14:39.986
Line #5 uh before D just click before D
def before def click.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3083-0
01:14:33.826 --> 01:14:33.946
OK.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3108-0

OK. Oh, no, I get it. No, I get it. OK.
Thank you.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3111-0
01:14:42.546 --> 01:14:47.626
That's it. Similarly, line #10, line #10,
go to the line #10.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3112-0
01:14:46.666 --> 01:14:47.906
Line #10.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3124-0
01:14:49.346 --> 01:14:52.746
Hmm. And yeah,
before the field did the same.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3131-0
01:14:50.826 --> 01:14:56.226
OK. Yeah, yeah. It's just a tab.
All right. OK, got it. Thank you.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3128-0
01:14:54.666 --> 01:14:54.866
Yes.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3147-0
01:14:56.346 --> 01:15:00.759
You're most welcome because you have
right this inside the constructor.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3147-1
01:15:00.759 --> 01:15:03.026
It should be outside the constructor.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3159-0
01:15:00.946 --> 01:15:08.786
Yeah, it should be. Yeah. OK, I get it.
I'll wait. How do I stop sharing?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3161-0
01:15:08.506 --> 01:15:10.786
No problem, no problem. I'm sure stopping.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3162-0
01:15:11.506 --> 01:15:11.906
Alright, OK.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3163-0
01:15:12.186 --> 01:15:12.266
Um.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3169-0
01:15:14.946 --> 01:15:17.666
Uh, so this this is the next one.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3176-0
01:15:42.786 --> 01:15:43.346
Just a second.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3208-0
01:16:45.466 --> 01:16:48.895
Then this parameterized constructor all
of you.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3208-1
01:16:48.895 --> 01:16:51.466
So which one is displayed this time?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3212-0
01:17:02.866 --> 01:17:04.626
EX1.5.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3224-0
01:17:08.186 --> 01:17:11.907
This will display the first one.
If you want to display others,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3224-1
01:17:11.907 --> 01:17:13.826
you can write the others as well.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3268-0
01:19:46.226 --> 01:19:49.706
OK, I'm checking.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3278-0
01:20:26.426 --> 01:20:26.546
Yes.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3282-0
01:20:38.066 --> 01:20:38.546
Yeah.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3286-0
01:20:52.826 --> 01:20:55.746
Can you find them?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3287-0
01:21:02.266 --> 01:21:02.426
2.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3321-0
01:21:05.746 --> 01:21:11.082
Yes, it should be.
So I need to do the next. Yes. OK, well,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3321-1
01:21:11.082 --> 01:21:14.728
no,
just remember the spelling should be

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3321-2
01:21:14.728 --> 01:21:20.153
correct, then two. And if you're right,
it's not the things.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3321-3
01:21:20.153 --> 01:21:23.266
It should be the same name exactly.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3351-0
01:21:23.546 --> 01:21:26.964
Init for constructor.
The rest you can write any the methods

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3351-1
01:21:26.964 --> 01:21:31.390
you are writing that could be anything
but the constructor name should be init

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3351-2
01:21:31.390 --> 01:21:35.648
only. This is the same thing right?
If you write something else it will not

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3351-3
01:21:35.648 --> 01:21:39.066
work. But this one,
this method name you can write anything.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3380-0
01:21:39.306 --> 01:21:42.960
Got it.
We have right with double N so it was not

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3380-1
01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:46.175
working.
So that that that's a constructor.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3380-2
01:21:46.175 --> 01:21:51.143
This is the default method because it's
called automatically right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3380-3
01:21:51.143 --> 01:21:54.066
So it's name it should be the same only.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3392-0
01:21:54.346 --> 01:22:00.334
In it only these you can change the
register and all that you can change

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3392-1
01:22:00.334 --> 01:22:00.826
right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3394-0
01:22:01.786 --> 01:22:02.746
Which one can I use?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3398-0
01:22:04.386 --> 01:22:06.066
You have used word double N.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3400-0
01:22:07.546 --> 01:22:08.906
You are right, Sir.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3408-0
01:22:11.586 --> 01:22:15.386
See, it will not work.
It will like something else.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3420-0
01:22:18.666 --> 01:22:23.426
No other method you can give any name,
but this one should be neat only.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3430-0
01:22:39.066 --> 01:22:45.688
In one under score is double.
So for you to use double under score. Yes,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3430-1
01:22:45.688 --> 01:22:49.226
the double under score is there single.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3434-0
01:22:51.226 --> 01:22:55.346
It done all of you this one.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3441-0
01:22:57.666 --> 01:23:01.866
Once you start writing,
it will help you out. It's come out.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3450-0
01:23:02.866 --> 01:23:06.546
See, see, see you late there.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3493-0
01:23:08.666 --> 01:23:13.316
See these are all double. Oh yeah,
you will like like this one.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3493-1
01:23:13.316 --> 01:23:18.764
You like they're all built in like this
one. So you just choose init fine.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3493-2
01:23:18.764 --> 01:23:22.687
So for example you have not write this
one right now.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3493-3
01:23:22.687 --> 01:23:28.426
You have not write right and you want to
write here. Yeah. So how we'll do it.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3504-0
01:23:28.626 --> 01:23:34.383
So we'll go here, enter.
We will let and you will let here and you

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3504-1
01:23:34.383 --> 01:23:35.586
will find out.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3508-0
01:23:36.826 --> 01:23:39.386
This one is here. We'll choose this enter.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3533-0
01:23:42.346 --> 01:23:48.326
So you need not write up anything. OK,
got it. So it will be fast.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3533-1
01:23:48.326 --> 01:23:53.056
So for decision all have to give number.
Absolutely.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3533-2
01:23:53.056 --> 01:23:56.626
All building like deaf you're late here.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3549-0
01:23:56.666 --> 01:24:00.766
Right here you you need not to type all
the things and you press enter.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3549-1
01:24:00.766 --> 01:24:04.924
It's automatically right for you.
The rest thing you want to do you just

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3549-2
01:24:04.924 --> 01:24:06.746
write ID just from the list huh.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3556-0
01:24:08.826 --> 01:24:11.626
So it will make the things faster, right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3569-0
01:24:33.146 --> 01:24:39.626
The help will come you press enter, enter.
It will whatever.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3575-0
01:24:44.946 --> 01:24:48.426
Done. OK,
now let's move to the next example.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3582-0
01:25:28.866 --> 01:25:29.506
That's.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3584-0
01:25:35.226 --> 01:25:35.626
Yes.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3608-0
01:26:12.226 --> 01:26:31.306
Initialize that you can have complete.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3609-0
01:26:31.386 --> 01:26:50.266
Yeah, it's.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3623-0
01:26:51.146 --> 01:26:58.185
Mr. Claud,
see if you want to check the second

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3623-1
01:26:58.185 --> 01:27:03.426
player, what you would like. Hello.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3625-0
01:27:05.266 --> 01:27:05.706
Yes.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3639-0
01:27:07.626 --> 01:27:13.198
And third one P3 dot display.
So if you want both you can write P2 dot

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3639-1
01:27:13.198 --> 01:27:13.826
display.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3643-0
01:27:16.106 --> 01:27:19.426
And P3 dot display.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3680-0
01:27:20.946 --> 01:27:24.234
OK,
so you can write it and you can check

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3680-1
01:27:24.234 --> 01:27:29.401
from here. So here is all three players.
Now one more thing here,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3680-2
01:27:29.401 --> 01:27:33.159
if you want to print the player directly,
fine,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3680-3
01:27:33.159 --> 01:27:37.386
so we can write here you'll do up to this
level done.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3725-0
01:27:39.866 --> 01:27:43.957
If you want to print directly,
I want to show you one more method.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3725-1
01:27:43.957 --> 01:27:48.902
So if you want to print print P1 so we'll
see here it will give you some sort of

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3725-2
01:27:48.902 --> 01:27:51.649
error.
But how we will handle this situation

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3725-3
01:27:51.649 --> 01:27:54.397
then there is a method that I will show
you.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3725-4
01:27:54.397 --> 01:27:58.426
So here the main player object add this
this is showing this one.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3747-0
01:27:58.906 --> 01:28:03.363
It is on the memory location fine.
So we don't want this,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3747-1
01:28:03.363 --> 01:28:09.586
we want the actual value of the player.
So for that we have here one method. OK.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3755-0
01:28:11.466 --> 01:28:16.106
To handle the situation,
we have one method. The method name is.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3757-0
01:28:25.426 --> 01:28:25.626
Stir.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3774-0
01:28:40.026 --> 01:28:44.792
I will show you the problem.
So we will use if you want to use this

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3774-1
01:28:44.792 --> 01:28:47.666
one. So we have a method. Method name is.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3775-0
01:28:51.506 --> 01:28:52.386
Death.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3777-0
01:28:55.106 --> 01:28:56.226
STR.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3788-0
01:28:57.626 --> 01:29:02.706
Right. We'll use that define strings.
So from here we write.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3792-0
01:29:06.586 --> 01:29:08.946
12 dot ID.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3794-0
01:29:11.666 --> 01:29:11.786
Yes.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3799-0
01:29:14.186 --> 01:29:16.226
Let's see.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3806-0
01:29:48.466 --> 01:29:50.306
What else we have team, right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3807-0
01:29:57.626 --> 01:29:58.586
This.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3808-0
01:30:03.386 --> 01:30:03.706
T.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3815-0
01:30:39.466 --> 01:30:41.106
This one.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3818-0
01:30:57.306 --> 01:30:57.426
But.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3819-0
01:30:59.666 --> 01:31:00.906
It will be good.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3822-0
01:31:05.466 --> 01:31:09.466
So he will do it.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3824-0
01:31:10.666 --> 01:31:11.826
You can do.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3827-0
01:31:14.826 --> 01:31:15.746
View terminal.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3838-0
01:31:19.306 --> 01:31:23.386
So here it is. We have written ID, name,
entity.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3888-0
01:31:37.506 --> 01:31:42.265
So this one is returning you this.
So now we have just printed this P1.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3888-1
01:31:42.265 --> 01:31:45.769
So if we have this,
this is a string it's returning.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3888-2
01:31:45.769 --> 01:31:48.743
So all the things we have right in this
one.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3888-3
01:31:48.743 --> 01:31:53.106
So if you want to print a P2 you need not
to use the display now.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3893-0
01:31:53.466 --> 01:31:57.306
You can directly use this way also print
P1.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3895-0
01:31:58.826 --> 01:31:59.346
E2.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3900-0
01:32:00.826 --> 01:32:02.146
E3 right? We'll go here.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3906-0
01:32:05.306 --> 01:32:07.106
So you have the P1P2P3.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3908-0
01:32:09.946 --> 01:32:12.066
You got it.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3920-0
01:32:15.786 --> 01:32:20.472
Even the display, if you don't want,
you can comment to this and you can

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3920-1
01:32:20.472 --> 01:32:21.306
directly use.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3921-0
01:32:23.626 --> 01:32:25.826
It is English, right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3960-0
01:32:36.186 --> 01:32:38.942
What?
What's the difference between having that

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3960-1
01:32:38.942 --> 01:32:42.214
and or having that?
This this one is that this this is a

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3960-2
01:32:42.214 --> 01:32:46.175
method and this is the string.
It will show you the same thing means

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3960-3
01:32:46.175 --> 01:32:48.759
every time you want to do the
concatenation,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3960-4
01:32:48.759 --> 01:32:52.146
you need not to call the method,
you just call the object.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3971-0
01:32:52.426 --> 01:32:55.585
You are calling the object is will print
anywhere.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3971-1
01:32:55.585 --> 01:32:58.186
This is the combination of all the things.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3974-0
01:33:02.466 --> 01:33:03.746
Play.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3986-0
01:33:04.746 --> 01:33:07.537
The one day is coming in the green one.
Mm-hmm.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/3986-1
01:33:07.537 --> 01:33:09.746
The one I don't need for this like it.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4020-0
01:33:11.826 --> 01:33:15.343
Which one?
I don't need that one for that that one

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4020-1
01:33:15.343 --> 01:33:19.687
is not required. Now you can just do.
If you want to use both,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4020-2
01:33:19.687 --> 01:33:25.134
you can use both also. But see here,
see here we need not to call the display.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4020-3
01:33:25.134 --> 01:33:26.306
We just write P1.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4024-0
01:33:26.866 --> 01:33:30.466
P2 and it will print from inside this one.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4033-0
01:33:31.626 --> 01:33:37.487
See here CLS in your screen.
So what object have everything is coming

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4033-1
01:33:37.487 --> 01:33:37.906
here.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4075-0
01:34:42.266 --> 01:34:47.281
Then you guys can take the break.
Now your breakfast has arrived.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4075-1
01:34:47.281 --> 01:34:53.663
You can do the breakfast after 20 minutes.
We will continue all of your online one.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4075-2
01:34:53.663 --> 01:34:58.146
Also you can take a break and join again
after 20 minutes.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4076-0
01:34:58.626 --> 01:34:59.026
OK.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4346-0
02:12:22.386 --> 02:12:29.906
Hello, all of you, please come online.
Are you there, guys?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4351-0
02:12:31.066 --> 02:12:33.346
Yes, Sir. Ready.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4360-0
02:12:32.666 --> 02:12:39.946
OK, let's let's begin.
So we have seen the example of this one.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4352-0
02:12:32.706 --> 02:12:33.106
Yes, uh.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4390-0
02:12:41.466 --> 02:12:46.902
This string representation of an object
with the string method that we have seen

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4390-1
02:12:46.902 --> 02:12:52.538
here, right? So here is the class player.
We have seen the string representation of

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4390-2
02:12:52.538 --> 02:12:53.746
the object, right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4421-0
02:12:56.186 --> 02:13:02.780
So this one is for number class person.
We have the shared name age and here we

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4421-1
02:13:02.780 --> 02:13:08.467
have put the string representation so
that we have seen right right.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4421-2
02:13:08.467 --> 02:13:12.506
This is the string.
This is the built in method.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4461-0
02:13:12.746 --> 02:13:16.074
So this is the string representation of
that object.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4461-1
02:13:16.074 --> 02:13:20.093
We have created the object and we have
represented as a string.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4461-2
02:13:20.093 --> 02:13:24.426
So we have directly call it.
If you will not use this method so then

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4461-3
02:13:24.426 --> 02:13:29.386
you can't do this print you can't do.
See for example here you have commented.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4464-0
02:13:29.986 --> 02:13:32.466
And you will go here view terminal.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4492-0
02:13:35.106 --> 02:13:38.403
Not what's are not working at the moment.
OK,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4492-1
02:13:38.403 --> 02:13:44.137
here is see it's giving you the the this
error because it's going to the memory

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4492-2
02:13:44.137 --> 02:13:49.584
location, not to the string right?
If you want exact a string then you have

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4492-3
02:13:49.584 --> 02:13:50.946
to use this method.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4496-0
02:14:02.346 --> 02:14:05.266
You have uncommented this one.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4501-0
02:14:09.906 --> 02:14:12.306
And you have printed again.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4506-0
02:14:14.346 --> 02:14:17.266
You have seen it here, see.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4508-0
02:14:18.826 --> 02:14:19.786
You got it?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4554-0
02:14:22.266 --> 02:14:27.755
Yes, it it's called the location only,
not the string representation like this

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4554-1
02:14:27.755 --> 02:14:31.090
one.
This object it's add this memory location,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4554-2
02:14:31.090 --> 02:14:34.703
add this memory location,
add this memory location.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4554-3
02:14:34.703 --> 02:14:39.706
But we don't want to show the memory
location, but we want to show the.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4558-0
02:14:39.746 --> 02:14:43.066
The string.
So in that case we will use it.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4567-0
02:14:45.266 --> 02:14:52.506
So we we have to open the the the screen
right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4574-0
02:14:54.466 --> 02:15:00.106
So anyone have any doubt question up to
now you can ask.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4580-0
02:15:02.546 --> 02:15:04.746
OK, now next yes.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4577-0
02:15:02.706 --> 02:15:02.986
So.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4592-0
02:15:05.906 --> 02:15:10.666
I still don't get it what self refers to,
what self actually refers to.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4593-0
02:15:11.746 --> 02:15:12.746
You have.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4603-0
02:15:13.226 --> 02:15:17.866
I still don't get it what self refer to.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4604-0
02:15:16.666 --> 02:15:20.146
OK, what what self do right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4607-0
02:15:20.346 --> 02:15:20.906
Uh, yes.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4666-0
02:15:21.346 --> 02:15:27.385
The self keyword OK see self is actually
represent that that we are going to

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4666-1
02:15:27.385 --> 02:15:30.992
discuss a particular instance for example
P1.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4666-2
02:15:30.992 --> 02:15:36.953
So we have created the P1 so self will go
to the that instance of this one.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4666-3
02:15:36.953 --> 02:15:41.266
For example you have a P1 player one MSD
and you have.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4710-0
02:15:41.346 --> 02:15:47.082
Print by P1 so it will go to that moment
location this that particular object.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4710-1
02:15:47.082 --> 02:15:50.422
So self denote to the instance of the
object.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4710-2
02:15:50.422 --> 02:15:56.230
It will not use the self that is for the
complete class that is a static thing.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4710-3
02:15:56.230 --> 02:16:00.586
For self it is instance for example P2 so
it will tell the.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4752-0
02:16:01.346 --> 02:16:06.605
Self means we will go to the P2 and it
will display for P2P3.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4752-1
02:16:06.605 --> 02:16:11.101
It will display to the P3.
The self is actually the.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4752-2
02:16:11.101 --> 02:16:17.633
It's representation of the instance of
the object right for the for the same

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4752-3
02:16:17.633 --> 02:16:21.026
object we are talking about for example.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4776-0
02:16:21.026 --> 02:16:25.753
You are talking about here P1 so it will
go to give you the value for P1.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4776-1
02:16:25.753 --> 02:16:30.672
How we get to know how we get to know
that this is the you are talking about

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4776-2
02:16:30.672 --> 02:16:33.866
the P1 display.
For example here let me show you.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4788-0
02:16:37.426 --> 02:16:42.357
You have created this three objects you
have created right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4788-1
02:16:42.357 --> 02:16:44.986
How many three you have created?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4797-0
02:16:47.746 --> 02:16:51.586
Three you have created and you have
display only the two.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4843-0
02:16:53.626 --> 02:16:57.496
But we have created P1 player, P2 player,
P3 player.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4843-1
02:16:57.496 --> 02:17:02.314
So how we get to know that which one we
are we are going to call,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4843-2
02:17:02.314 --> 02:17:07.498
we are going to call the P2.
From here we are going to call the P2 but

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4843-3
02:17:07.498 --> 02:17:11.586
here ID name and team how we will get to
know which ID?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4884-0
02:17:11.866 --> 02:17:16.291
Because P1 also have the ID,
P2 also have the ID,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4884-1
02:17:16.291 --> 02:17:22.398
P3 also have the ID right?
So from here the self itself tell that we

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4884-2
02:17:22.398 --> 02:17:28.948
are going to discuss of the same same
player that object you have passed.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4884-3
02:17:28.948 --> 02:17:31.426
So if you use P2 so it will.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4901-0
02:17:31.506 --> 02:17:35.570
Give you the value for P2.
If you'll enter the P3,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4901-1
02:17:35.570 --> 02:17:41.626
it will give you the value for P3 self
represent the same instance. Got it?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4902-0
02:17:42.626 --> 02:17:43.106
Yes, yes.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4904-0
02:17:46.106 --> 02:17:46.346
No.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4906-0
02:17:48.546 --> 02:17:49.986
Clear this part.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4911-0
02:18:06.866 --> 02:18:08.546
Oh, next is uh.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4915-0
02:18:22.866 --> 02:18:24.306
Inheritance.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4920-0
02:18:27.466 --> 02:18:29.906
Inheritance is allows you.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4956-0
02:18:34.226 --> 02:18:40.684
Inheritance allows you the properties and
methods from another class. For example,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4956-1
02:18:40.684 --> 02:18:46.053
we have created a class animal and the
animal have the method speak.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4956-2
02:18:46.053 --> 02:18:51.266
So if we have write the speak then we we
will write another class.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4977-0
02:18:51.426 --> 02:18:56.135
That is inherited class and we want to
use the earlier class method.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4977-1
02:18:56.135 --> 02:18:59.753
So how we will do,
we will do using the inheritance.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4977-2
02:18:59.753 --> 02:19:01.186
Let me show you here.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4979-0
02:19:01.946 --> 02:19:03.306
For example.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4989-0
02:19:14.506 --> 02:19:20.224
This one is done.
Let me create here one more new file.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4989-1
02:19:20.224 --> 02:19:22.266
This is inheritance.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4991-0
02:19:25.626 --> 02:19:26.666
Example.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4993-0
02:19:28.266 --> 02:19:28.826
Dirt 5.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/4994-0
02:19:32.026 --> 02:19:32.226
Right.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5009-0
02:19:33.266 --> 02:19:39.192
We have created here a class.
Let's say class name is EMT employee we

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5009-1
02:19:39.192 --> 02:19:40.546
have right here.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5011-0

02:19:55.066 --> 02:19:55.706
That's.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5014-0
02:20:00.586 --> 02:20:01.826

02:20:10.226 --> 02:20:14.226
ID and just two things for example we
have.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5024-0
02:20:17.946 --> 02:20:19.066

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5030-0
02:20:25.546 --> 02:20:28.426
We have here.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5038-0
02:20:48.986 --> 02:20:51.786

Yeah, it is me.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5053-0
02:21:38.706 --> 02:21:42.026
That's fine. You have created one class.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5062-0
02:21:44.146 --> 02:21:51.946
Last name is developer and developer is
drive from the EMP.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5067-0
02:21:55.666 --> 02:21:56.786
Here we have defined.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5069-0
02:22:02.306 --> 02:22:02.546
Welcome.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5070-0
02:22:08.266 --> 02:22:08.546

W back.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5076-0
02:22:21.986 --> 02:22:22.106
OK.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5102-0
02:22:25.346 --> 02:22:30.547
We have just write this route.
Now see this is an inherited class,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5102-1
02:22:30.547 --> 02:22:36.756
so whatever you have inside the employee,
you can access it using the developer

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5102-2
02:22:36.756 --> 02:22:38.386
also. So D developer.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5108-0
02:22:41.186 --> 02:22:45.746
We have created the developer.
We are ready dot.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5120-0
02:22:47.626 --> 02:22:55.746
Register and we have passed from here the
ID one name is Sam.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5147-0
02:22:57.986 --> 02:23:05.206
And we have display D dot display so
because this is a child class of this one

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5147-1
02:23:05.206 --> 02:23:12.975
so you can access all the members of this
employee and plus this on methods as well.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5147-2
02:23:12.975 --> 02:23:13.706

We don't want to pass,
we want to use only.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5221-0
02:25:36.946 --> 02:25:38.786
Ready one in this.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5232-0
02:26:01.946 --> 02:26:06.306
We want to just pause the ID server dot
ID.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5236-0
02:26:09.226 --> 02:26:10.386
Say the name.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5245-0
02:26:20.586 --> 02:26:26.506
Without this form that you want to use,
which I saw clear that will be good.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5265-0
02:26:28.026 --> 02:26:32.142
Let me just do this.
So I don't want to write in curly braces,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5265-1
02:26:32.142 --> 02:26:35.866
I want to write directly.
So here is control V terminal.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5293-0
02:26:37.306 --> 02:26:42.117
Series Python example.
Welcome to developer ID one names.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5293-1
02:26:42.117 --> 02:26:48.254
So let me explain it. How is it working?
See you have the class employee.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5293-2
02:26:48.254 --> 02:26:54.226
Employee is your base class,
base or superclass. Fine. So this is your.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5297-0
02:26:56.546 --> 02:26:59.826
Superclass. This one is known as.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5314-0
02:27:02.506 --> 02:27:10.194
Superclass or base class or parent class?
What do we call it?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5314-1
02:27:10.194 --> 02:27:13.666
Superclass or base class or?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5316-0
02:27:15.826 --> 02:27:17.586
For parent class.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5326-0
02:27:18.746 --> 02:27:25.666
Fine and this the developer is it's drive
class inherited class.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5328-0
02:27:34.226 --> 02:27:35.386
Inherited.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5331-0
02:27:47.906 --> 02:27:51.186
Inherited class or.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5334-0
02:27:52.986 --> 02:27:55.266
Where are you to class?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5337-0
02:27:59.506 --> 02:28:01.666
Or child class.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5371-0
02:28:04.506 --> 02:28:09.577
This class can access all the members of
parent class, right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5371-1
02:28:09.577 --> 02:28:15.794
So if you'll create the object of this D,
you can access all the members of

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5371-2
02:28:15.794 --> 02:28:19.393
employee,
but you will create the object of

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5371-3
02:28:19.393 --> 02:28:22.746
employee, you can't access the member of.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5388-0
02:28:22.826 --> 02:28:27.540
Drive class got it.
So for example you have created the

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5388-1
02:28:27.540 --> 02:28:32.506
object of employee class. This is EMP.
You have created E.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5438-0
02:28:35.626 --> 02:28:40.602
E is equal to EMP.
This is the object of employee class.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5438-1
02:28:40.602 --> 02:28:47.410
You can call the register if you want.
So here you have register one employee

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5438-2
02:28:47.410 --> 02:28:54.306
103 for example 102 and the name is Raj
and you want to display E dot display.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5456-0
02:28:54.826 --> 02:28:59.031
You can display it,
but if you want to call welcome,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5456-1
02:28:59.031 --> 02:29:03.473
you can't call.
Welcome will give you the error, right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5456-2
02:29:03.473 --> 02:29:04.346
So here is.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5474-0
02:29:09.226 --> 02:29:14.736
This is the basic one I have showed you.
After this we will see that the method

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5474-1
02:29:14.736 --> 02:29:17.146
overriding as well. So here is 1-2.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5520-0
02:29:20.306 --> 02:29:24.673
So what the benefit is?
The benefit is if you have one built in

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5520-1
02:29:24.673 --> 02:29:30.268
one class already and you want to use it,
so you need not write the methods again

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5520-2
02:29:30.268 --> 02:29:33.885
for the next class,
you can call it directly, right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5520-3
02:29:33.885 --> 02:29:38.866
So this is the developer is inherited
class and this is your base class.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5522-0
02:29:43.186 --> 02:29:43.666
Do it.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5575-0
02:29:49.546 --> 02:29:53.009
For example,
developer want to write this thing

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5575-1
02:29:53.009 --> 02:29:58.348
differently. So how we will do it?
We'll do that one in the next example.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5575-2
02:29:58.348 --> 02:30:03.904
Here we have a class employee right?
So employee class have the register and

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5575-3
02:30:03.904 --> 02:30:09.026
display method and the developer is a
drive class of employee dev EMP.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5584-0
02:30:09.546 --> 02:30:13.819
So using the developer,
we can access all the members that we

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5584-1
02:30:13.819 --> 02:30:16.506
have inside the employee class. Got it?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5586-0
02:30:31.786 --> 02:30:31.906
Yes.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5588-0
02:30:47.506 --> 02:30:53.506
Do you?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5593-0
02:31:03.866 --> 02:31:06.346
You have to call him.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5610-0
02:31:08.786 --> 02:31:24.586
Oh, yes, for the welcome one. Yes, yes,
I have had this welcome for for you.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5622-0
02:31:24.586 --> 02:31:34.706
See this is the default behavior.
First you will do it then if you want to.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5627-0
02:32:04.946 --> 02:32:05.266
OK.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5634-0
02:32:21.666 --> 02:32:23.666
I need the volume set up.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5645-0
02:33:27.906 --> 02:33:28.386
Thank you.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5650-0
02:33:42.826 --> 02:33:47.026
Thank you.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5657-0
02:33:47.986 --> 02:33:56.346
I see, I see that. So I have the.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5658-0
02:33:57.026 --> 02:34:01.306
Oh, welcome to.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5659-0
02:34:04.226 --> 02:34:05.346
Yeah.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5660-0
02:34:08.506 --> 02:34:09.066
Something.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5661-0
02:34:27.146 --> 02:34:28.506
Yes.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5669-0
02:34:42.426 --> 02:35:00.266
If you will go ahead in somewhere,
then I can.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5671-0
02:35:00.306 --> 02:35:01.266
Why cancel?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5687-0
02:35:16.026 --> 02:35:33.026
See the next thing is polymorphism.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5738-0
02:35:33.266 --> 02:35:36.941
Polymorphism.
You know what the meaning of polymorphism

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5738-1
02:35:36.941 --> 02:35:42.060
means one thing you have that have the
multiple form of that that is known as

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5738-2
02:35:42.060 --> 02:35:46.391
polymorphism. For example,
here we have the employee register and

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5738-3
02:35:46.391 --> 02:35:50.919
display right in the developer.
We want the registration and display

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5738-4
02:35:50.919 --> 02:35:51.706
differently.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5770-0
02:35:52.786 --> 02:35:58.501
Right, so that is polymorphous.
Polymorphous means to have the multiple

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5770-1
02:35:58.501 --> 02:36:03.819
format of the same thing.
So here is polymorphous allows method to

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5770-2
02:36:03.819 --> 02:36:07.946
have different implementation based on
the objects.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5793-0
02:36:29.106 --> 02:36:35.677
Then we will change this one as well.
So first I'm showing you here this one.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5793-1
02:36:35.677 --> 02:36:41.826
Also I will make the polymorphism example.
So first we will go here new.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5795-0
02:36:42.786 --> 02:36:44.026
Five only.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5799-0
02:36:48.906 --> 02:36:49.506
Ex.py.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5802-0
02:36:52.426 --> 02:36:53.946
Volumor Facebook exam.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5809-0
02:36:56.386 --> 02:36:59.266
See here this is the basic one.
We have a class.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5815-0
02:37:04.466 --> 02:37:07.706
Could I write for you? OK,
let me write that will be good.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5818-0
02:37:09.826 --> 02:37:13.386
We have a class, let's say board.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5835-0
02:37:15.426 --> 02:37:24.064
And inside this class we have a method
defined like there is self and we have

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5835-1
02:37:24.064 --> 02:37:25.946
right here print.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5846-0
02:37:29.186 --> 02:37:36.666
Bird can fly, right?
We have read one more here.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5855-0
02:37:38.226 --> 02:37:45.826
One more class. The class is, let's say,
uh, something.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5857-0
02:37:55.466 --> 02:37:55.826
Airplane.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5890-0
02:37:57.586 --> 02:38:02.166
Here play if you're right and you want to
do the inheritance,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5890-1
02:38:02.166 --> 02:38:07.705
you have to write the class name here
bird and you have right here define.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5890-2
02:38:07.705 --> 02:38:12.506
This is a fly as well.
Here you write self and you have printed.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5894-0
02:38:15.466 --> 02:38:16.626
Print this one is.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5918-0
02:38:19.506 --> 02:38:23.690
The plane fly.
So both have the same thing right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5918-1
02:38:23.690 --> 02:38:30.635
Both both have the fly method, fly method.
But in this first class if you'll write

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5918-2
02:38:30.635 --> 02:38:34.066
here you have created the object of bird.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5941-0
02:38:34.826 --> 02:38:43.922
Bird object let's see B is equal to bird
and you have call B dot fly so it will

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5941-1
02:38:43.922 --> 02:38:49.266
give you the different thing and if you
write.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5944-0
02:38:58.786 --> 02:39:00.586
Word implementation.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5948-0
02:39:05.026 --> 02:39:07.146
And this is current.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5952-0
02:39:11.906 --> 02:39:14.466
Airplane implementation.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5958-0
02:39:18.186 --> 02:39:21.146
You have right here A is equal to.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5960-0
02:39:24.266 --> 02:39:25.466
We are playing.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/5962-0
02:39:27.946 --> 02:39:28.466
A dot like.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6001-0
02:39:29.786 --> 02:39:34.859
So here then this time it will call the
bird and it will say bird can fly.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6001-1
02:39:34.859 --> 02:39:39.798
In this time it will call the airplane
and it will say airplane can fly.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6001-2
02:39:39.798 --> 02:39:45.209
This is just to understand the syntax.
The real example I will write after this

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6001-3
02:39:45.209 --> 02:39:47.306
right? First we'll do this one.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6004-0
02:39:48.386 --> 02:39:49.986
Here it is.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6007-0
02:39:50.986 --> 02:39:52.426
What's the name?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6009-0
02:39:57.066 --> 02:39:59.146
EX dot file.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6053-0
02:40:00.146 --> 02:40:05.249
Here is bird implement is bird can fly
and in aeroplane means it will call the

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6053-1
02:40:05.249 --> 02:40:10.481
aeroplane dot fly means if you are using
the object of the bird it will call the

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6053-2
02:40:10.481 --> 02:40:13.775
bird one.
If you are going to create the object of

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6053-3
02:40:13.775 --> 02:40:16.746
the aeroplane it will call the aeroplane
one.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6092-0
02:40:17.386 --> 02:40:22.720
You can do this way also.
You can write all the objects inside this

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6092-1
02:40:22.720 --> 02:40:26.407
one and based on that you can call the
method.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6092-2
02:40:26.407 --> 02:40:32.604
For example here for OBJ in bird and
aeroplane there is the collection of bird

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6092-3
02:40:32.604 --> 02:40:35.506
and aeroplane you have write OBJ fly.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6095-0
02:40:35.986 --> 02:40:38.186
So here is view terminal.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6097-0
02:40:42.826 --> 02:40:43.826
Oh, here it is.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6112-0
02:40:44.986 --> 02:40:49.215
Bird can fly and airplane can fly.
If you want to use the phone,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6112-1
02:40:49.215 --> 02:40:50.386
let me just print.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6114-0
02:40:52.906 --> 02:40:53.106
Uzim.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6115-0
02:40:56.186 --> 02:40:56.866
Or loop.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6118-0
02:41:03.626 --> 02:41:04.986
Exceleration.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6127-0
02:41:13.266 --> 02:41:17.685
I think it's excellent.
I think my keyboard is have changed or

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6127-1
02:41:17.685 --> 02:41:18.386
something.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6139-0
02:42:28.506 --> 02:42:28.826
OK.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6147-0
02:42:52.786 --> 02:43:03.306
And then.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6148-0
02:43:08.826 --> 02:43:08.906
Hi.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6199-0
02:43:20.666 --> 02:43:23.857
Then we will see one real time use case
after this.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6199-1
02:43:23.857 --> 02:43:28.704
This is just to understand the syntax
because we have the same methods because

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6199-2
02:43:28.704 --> 02:43:33.367
you can call it using the aeroplane.
Also you can call it using the bird as

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6199-3
02:43:33.367 --> 02:43:36.681
well, right?
So it it's called the same method but in

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6199-4
02:43:36.681 --> 02:43:39.626
aeroplane this is the different
implementation.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6228-0
02:43:39.986 --> 02:43:43.464
And in world this is the different
implementation.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6228-1
02:43:43.464 --> 02:43:48.646
So similarly for employee we want to
create for the developer the different

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6228-2
02:43:48.646 --> 02:43:53.487
implementation and for this one for
employee different implementation.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6228-3
02:43:53.487 --> 02:43:56.146
I will show you after this we'll do it.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6230-0
02:43:56.346 --> 02:43:58.226
Fast then I will show you that.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6236-0
02:44:00.506 --> 02:44:04.026
What should I ask you to do like exercise?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6239-0
02:44:08.346 --> 02:44:09.666
Huh. That will be good, right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6250-0
02:44:11.586 --> 02:44:16.186
OK, first I will do one more example,
then after that I will ask.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6279-0
02:44:42.506 --> 02:44:47.323
Just hang on. Yes,
this is a calling number meeting is a.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6279-1
02:44:47.323 --> 02:44:52.637
It's the B flyer here. Yes, A flyer,
right, right, B flyer. No,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6279-2
02:44:52.637 --> 02:44:57.786
because we have created this object A
here. A is for a plane.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6295-0
02:44:58.146 --> 02:45:00.850
And B is for bird, right?
We have rated B dot flight,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6295-1
02:45:00.850 --> 02:45:04.154
so it will give you the bird one and we
have called a dot flight.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6295-2
02:45:04.154 --> 02:45:05.906
It will give you the aeroplane one.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6296-0
02:45:05.946 --> 02:45:06.066
Tim.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6342-0
02:45:14.106 --> 02:45:18.235
You can write any name,
but this one is denote to aeroplane.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6342-1
02:45:18.235 --> 02:45:22.972
This one is denote to bird.
Right here we have read the same thing in

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6342-2
02:45:22.972 --> 02:45:26.424
one go bird and aeroplane.
So OBJ is denoting the.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6342-3
02:45:26.424 --> 02:45:31.026
In first case it will be bird,
in second case it will be aeroplane.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6345-0
02:45:32.746 --> 02:45:35.106
Here we are right in board and.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6359-0
02:46:32.226 --> 02:46:34.026
Online one as well. Have you done?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6363-0
02:46:36.186 --> 02:46:36.706
Completed.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6364-0

Thanks, uh.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6373-0
02:46:38.706 --> 02:46:42.457
OK,
So what we will do is we will select then

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6373-1

It will store the ID,
name and domain in developer case and in

both the things plus the domain in case
of developer.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6780-3
02:54:03.845 --> 02:54:09.246
So the benefit of this one we are not
right in this developer class all these

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6780-4
02:54:09.246 --> 02:54:10.146
things again.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6821-0
02:54:10.746 --> 02:54:14.860
We have to just add the.
We have just add the domain in this one.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6821-1
02:54:14.860 --> 02:54:18.102
The rest thing it will take from the
earlier class.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6821-2
02:54:18.102 --> 02:54:22.715
Similarly to display this one,
we need not to write the all things again,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6821-3
02:54:22.715 --> 02:54:27.826
the all things it will display from the
employee class and the rest is from here.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6856-0
02:54:28.266 --> 02:54:32.889
So that is known as polymorphism.
The same methods because the developer

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6856-1
02:54:32.889 --> 02:54:36.308
can also call these methods display and
the register.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6856-2
02:54:36.308 --> 02:54:41.627
So we have called inside the method this
one super dot register, super dot display.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6856-3
02:54:41.627 --> 02:54:45.426
What that means we are going to call the
superclass method.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6880-0
02:54:48.506 --> 02:54:56.216
So just one question to to all of you.
If I will write here,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6880-1
02:54:56.216 --> 02:55:03.546
I have right here the let's write DD one
is equal to tab.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6886-0
02:55:04.026 --> 02:55:07.826
I have right this one right and I have
right here.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6889-0
02:55:12.386 --> 02:55:14.906
E1 dot.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6890-0
02:55:14.986 --> 02:55:15.146
What?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6907-0
02:55:16.466 --> 02:55:24.655
Register and one more D1 dot display.
So what will be the output in this case?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6907-1
02:55:24.655 --> 02:55:28.386
Any of you? What will be the output?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6913-0
02:55:30.626 --> 02:55:34.306
Online,
offline any of you how it will execute?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6968-0
02:55:35.746 --> 02:55:39.398
You have right D1 dot register.
So this is D1 dot register.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6968-1
02:55:39.398 --> 02:55:42.563
It will go here.
This is the register method right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6968-2
02:55:42.563 --> 02:55:46.520
D1 register developer register.
It will call super dot register.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6968-3
02:55:46.520 --> 02:55:50.416
Super dot register means it will go here.
It will ask enter ID.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6968-4
02:55:50.416 --> 02:55:54.311
Whatever the ID you have entered,
it will store inside this ID.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/6968-5
02:55:54.311 --> 02:55:55.346
Then it will ask.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7011-0
02:55:55.506 --> 02:56:00.509
Enter name whatever the name you have
entered, it will store inside the name.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7011-1
02:56:00.509 --> 02:56:04.998
Then after this this line will come out
self dot domain enter domain.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7011-2
02:56:04.998 --> 02:56:09.680
So you have insert the domain domain also
it's stored inside the domain.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7011-3
02:56:09.680 --> 02:56:14.746
Then the next line will come out D1 dot
display. In this case it will go here.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7034-0
02:56:15.186 --> 02:56:23.741
From here it will call the main to name
self dot name ID self dot ID plus domain

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7034-1
02:56:23.741 --> 02:56:27.226
self dot domain. Let me show you.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7043-0
02:56:28.226 --> 02:56:32.576
View terminal.
Then I will ask you one question after

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7043-1
02:56:32.576 --> 02:56:34.026
this. CLS here is.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7049-0
02:56:35.706 --> 02:56:41.546
Under ID 12, name Sam,
domain is developer.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7061-0
02:56:44.426 --> 02:56:51.186
Developer and here the name ID domain.
Everything is displayed. Got it.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7080-0
02:58:44.586 --> 02:58:45.306
Hmm.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7106-0
03:00:19.746 --> 03:00:24.986
Any doubt question up to now?
Any of you online guys? Is it done?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7111-0
03:00:26.506 --> 03:00:29.306
If done, please say done.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7112-0

03:03:58.506 --> 03:03:58.826
Right.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7177-0
03:04:00.066 --> 03:04:01.866
The matrix. You see what I mean?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7180-0
03:04:19.026 --> 03:04:23.146
We're not saying. Thank you.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7181-0
03:04:30.066 --> 03:04:31.226
I'm sure what happened.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7182-0
03:04:34.066 --> 03:04:46.146
Uh, she doesn't have any mind.
I think we should be better. Sit. Sit.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7188-0
03:04:47.306 --> 03:04:57.746

Yeah.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7190-0
03:05:03.986 --> 03:05:04.146
8.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7194-0
03:05:07.346 --> 03:05:09.586
One extended months clear.

03:05:20.626 --> 03:05:26.026
I'm dead. I'm dead self.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7200-0
03:05:27.786 --> 03:05:28.186
This.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7201-0
03:05:30.386 --> 03:05:31.466

I think, I think that's why the object.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7221-0
03:05:54.786 --> 03:06:00.186
So would be a.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7226-0
03:06:08.066 --> 03:06:17.546
I don't think.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7227-0
03:06:24.306 --> 03:06:24.666
Yeah.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7228-0
03:06:28.026 --> 03:06:28.106
Oh.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7231-0
03:06:29.826 --> 03:06:32.666
And to your.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7232-0
03:06:34.746 --> 03:06:35.026
Mm.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7236-0

We we don't need me. I don't. I'm more.
Thank you.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7239-0
03:06:42.786 --> 03:06:53.146
Yeah, excuse me.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7257-0
03:06:58.706 --> 03:07:12.535
OK, done all of you this.
I'm I'm writing here the hawk code for

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7257-1
03:07:12.535 --> 03:07:13.386
you.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7273-0
03:07:14.306 --> 03:07:19.520
And then you have to just show me how to
call it, right? Just calling.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7273-1
03:07:19.520 --> 03:07:24.366
I'm doing asking to you.
I'm writing here for the this is example

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7273-2
03:07:24.366 --> 03:07:24.586
#3.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7284-0
03:07:49.146 --> 03:07:54.986
Here is done. Should I go to next?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7287-0
03:08:03.626 --> 03:08:05.026
New this is.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7290-0
03:08:07.706 --> 03:08:09.146
Constructor inheritance.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7300-0
03:08:12.106 --> 03:08:16.357
EX.
5 This is constructor inheritance I'm

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7300-1
03:08:16.357 --> 03:08:18.786
showing to you right so.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7305-0
03:08:21.826 --> 03:08:24.586
I'm writing the similar thing.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7320-0
03:08:28.226 --> 03:08:33.541
But this time you will do the the half
thing I'm going to ask you, right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7320-1
03:08:33.541 --> 03:08:34.906
So here is a class.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7333-0
03:08:36.066 --> 03:08:45.346
Class name is employee and here we are
going to write def. Let me just do.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7334-0
03:08:46.266 --> 03:08:47.066
Deft.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7339-0
03:08:50.346 --> 03:08:54.586
In it right and I'm writing here the.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7341-0
03:08:57.066 --> 03:08:57.506
ID.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7349-0
03:09:00.586 --> 03:09:04.586
Name qualification. There's three things.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7366-0
03:09:06.386 --> 03:09:12.070
Qualification.
Three things I'm taking from here.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7366-1
03:09:12.070 --> 03:09:17.186
So self dot ID is equal to ID self dot
name.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7369-0
03:09:22.306 --> 03:09:24.306
Is equal to name.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7374-0
03:09:26.666 --> 03:09:29.426
And self dot qualification.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7385-0
03:09:32.946 --> 03:09:38.746
Is equal to qualification OK and I have
rated this display.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7392-0
03:09:53.626 --> 03:09:56.466
Display self here is.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/7398-0
03:10:01.706 --> 03:10:04.170

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8534-0
03:47:01.226 --> 03:47:05.866
Then you can then try.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8535-0
03:47:07.546 --> 03:47:07.746
Yes.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8536-0
03:47:09.626 --> 03:47:09.986
Yes.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8538-0
03:47:11.346 --> 03:47:15.026
OK, then you will be able to.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8540-0
03:47:17.506 --> 03:47:19.066
Number 39.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8550-0
03:47:28.906 --> 03:47:33.146
Where we have been to EMP, we are not.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8551-0
03:47:34.506 --> 03:47:36.066
You know.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8579-0
03:47:39.026 --> 03:47:46.886
Oh, no, you went. Yeah, I do.
If you're right, you want to. I see. OK,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8579-1
03:47:46.886 --> 03:47:49.986
don't check. I'll make sure.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8580-0
03:47:56.026 --> 03:47:56.146
OK.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8582-0
03:47:57.386 --> 03:48:12.546
I miss. I didn't say that.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8585-0
03:48:31.466 --> 03:48:46.626
I think we can. We'll wait. This week one.
That's it, right? Yeah. I think that.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8591-0
03:48:49.706 --> 03:49:02.026
So how to enable the highlight?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8614-0
03:49:03.946 --> 03:49:11.197
Hello. Yeah you have this highlighting.
What do you want to do?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8614-1
03:49:11.197 --> 03:49:18.107
I want to enable this highlight.
You have not read the code.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8614-2
03:49:18.107 --> 03:49:21.506
You want to read the code now.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8617-0
03:49:21.866 --> 03:49:23.346
No, I want to.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8632-0
03:49:25.426 --> 03:49:30.702
This highlight. Why is it?
Because you have used the details.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8632-1
03:49:30.702 --> 03:49:34.786
Wherever the details it will go to the
details.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8665-0
03:49:37.026 --> 03:49:40.846
For example,
this one you have select to wherever the

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8665-1
03:49:40.846 --> 03:49:45.161
same it will select that one.
Is it normal? Can I? No. Yeah,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8665-2
03:49:45.161 --> 03:49:48.415
it's just me.
Even if you don't want to that,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8665-3
03:49:48.415 --> 03:49:52.306
I don't want to. It's insert.
Where is insert? Insert.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8675-0
03:49:52.506 --> 03:49:58.977
Yes, we're listening to that.
I'll talk to this. It's clear.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8675-1
03:49:58.977 --> 03:50:02.266
I never listened. It was to be.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8687-0
03:50:03.386 --> 03:50:18.776
This is enormous.
We will change with the screenboard is

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8687-1
03:50:18.776 --> 03:50:20.666
screen.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8692-0
03:50:22.866 --> 03:50:36.066
It's it's wrong. It's right.
It's not changing the other one.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8715-0
03:50:38.146 --> 03:50:43.131
Mm-hmm. Yeah, right.
It's changing only the six highlights

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8715-1
03:50:43.131 --> 03:50:47.017
here.
That's the same thing is there as well.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8715-2
03:50:47.017 --> 03:50:53.354
Otherwise we'll not change both.
We'll change only one three. That's fine.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8715-3
03:50:53.354 --> 03:50:55.466
That's what it should be.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8721-0
03:50:55.546 --> 03:51:05.306
Sir, Sir, yes, we can't answer. Sorry,
the the.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8751-0
03:51:07.226 --> 03:51:11.255
Display and print is doing what?
No a difference. OK,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8751-1
03:51:11.255 --> 03:51:15.880
display and print are different.
See the display is a method.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8751-2
03:51:15.880 --> 03:51:19.386
You can give any name to the this this
method.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8760-0
03:51:20.426 --> 03:51:26.066
Clear key binding input escape.
This is a function.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8761-0
03:51:30.306 --> 03:51:31.226
Think that.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8796-0
03:51:57.746 --> 03:52:09.263
See they are asking the print and display.
This is a method right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8796-1
03:52:09.263 --> 03:52:16.826
So method you can give any names let's
say.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8798-0
03:52:17.146 --> 03:52:19.586
I call it the uh.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8807-0
03:52:21.226 --> 03:52:28.066
Info. So I am writing this so info, right?
Let's say so.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8831-0
03:52:29.826 --> 03:52:35.111
Show info. This is a method.
You can write any name to this one.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8831-1
03:52:35.111 --> 03:52:40.884
This is not built in right.
Let show info so it will become show info.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8831-2
03:52:40.884 --> 03:52:44.706
When you are going to call you will call
here.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8832-0
03:52:46.266 --> 03:52:46.706
Yeah.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8876-0
03:52:47.706 --> 03:52:52.703
Show info here also we will call show
info. So this is our method name.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8876-1
03:52:52.703 --> 03:52:58.534
You can give any name because I have used
2-3 times display so you might think that

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8876-2
03:52:58.534 --> 03:53:01.726
it is only the display.
You can use anything.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8876-3
03:53:01.726 --> 03:53:07.418
This is just for displaying we have used
so we have read show info now if you run

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8876-4
03:53:07.418 --> 03:53:07.626
it.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8891-0
03:53:10.066 --> 03:53:17.506
We'll go your view terminal. Huh.
Print is a built in function.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8891-1
03:53:17.506 --> 03:53:21.226
This is a comment. Sorry Python.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8895-0
03:53:23.506 --> 03:53:26.706
DX dot PY.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8920-0
03:53:28.706 --> 03:53:33.998
So here is dev show info show info.
It's giving you the error.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8920-1
03:53:33.998 --> 03:53:39.794
Why it's giving you the error?
Because we have rate super is display

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8920-2
03:53:39.794 --> 03:53:42.986
display is store info now what is now?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8921-0
03:53:43.666 --> 03:53:44.066
Showing.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8922-0
03:53:45.986 --> 03:53:46.466
So.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8927-0
03:53:51.026 --> 03:53:52.746
The score in full.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8942-0
03:53:53.786 --> 03:53:57.037
Right.
So similarly other you have changed.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8942-1
03:53:57.037 --> 03:54:00.066
So this is the this one we have done now.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8943-0
03:54:02.946 --> 03:54:06.146
Oh, it says a return command return.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8963-0
03:54:07.306 --> 03:54:13.054
Return is returning you the data.
This is the function. No, no,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/8963-1
03:54:13.054 --> 03:54:16.466
you can't change. This is the keyword.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/9020-0
03:54:17.626 --> 03:54:22.143
That is known as keyword.
If something is there, that is keyword.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/9020-1
03:54:22.143 --> 03:54:25.906
So the return is a keyword.
Super is a keyword, right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/9020-2
03:54:25.906 --> 03:54:30.081
Class is a keyword. Def is a keyword.
You can't change them.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/9020-3
03:54:30.081 --> 03:54:35.282
Keywords mean a special kind of word that
have some sort of meaning for the

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/9020-4
03:54:35.282 --> 03:54:37.266
interpreter for the compiler.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/9055-0
03:54:37.546 --> 03:54:42.379
So the def it will get to know that you
have defined it. So that is the def.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/9055-1
03:54:42.379 --> 03:54:45.831
You have to write only def, def, def.
This is a class.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/9055-2
03:54:45.831 --> 03:54:50.664
You have to write only the class to
define it till that this we are going to

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/9055-3
03:54:50.664 --> 03:54:52.986
create the class. Class is a keyword.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/9066-0
03:54:52.986 --> 03:54:57.999
And this def is keyword and then the
super is a keyword. Fine,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/9066-1
03:54:57.999 --> 03:55:00.466
you have to use the super only.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/9081-0
03:55:01.786 --> 03:55:04.554
The rest is your own.
You can write anything.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/9081-1
03:55:04.554 --> 03:55:07.202
You can write this.
Self is also a keyword.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/9081-2
03:55:07.202 --> 03:55:08.466
The rest you can use.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/9113-0
03:55:10.226 --> 03:55:12.868
OK,
so keyword means that is special word

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/9113-1
03:55:12.868 --> 03:55:17.461
that compiler have some meaning.
So you have to use only those like this

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/9113-2
03:55:17.461 --> 03:55:20.292
one.
This init is a built in function so you

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/9113-3
03:55:20.292 --> 03:55:23.626
have to write that one only init for
initialization.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/9164-0
03:55:41.546 --> 03:55:45.588
No, they they they have asked. No,
you need not to do.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/9164-1
03:55:45.588 --> 03:55:50.731
They have asked that can we write
something else in place of display.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/9164-2
03:55:50.731 --> 03:55:54.038
So I have write this so in place of
display.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/9164-3
03:55:54.038 --> 03:55:59.770
Yeah earlier one is correct but they have
asked can we use something else for

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/9164-4
03:55:59.770 --> 03:56:01.386
display so we can use.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/9177-0
03:56:01.466 --> 03:56:07.430
So then you say this is a user defined
method. This is your own functions, right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/9177-1
03:56:07.430 --> 03:56:10.266
Your own. Well, you can write anything.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/9183-0
03:56:11.186 --> 03:56:15.346
Just two because right to be you have not.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/9236-0
03:56:16.306 --> 03:56:20.616
Listen what he's asking.
So here guys online one also he one

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/9236-1
03:56:20.616 --> 03:56:24.714
question is arise.
They are asking can we use this is the

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/9236-2
03:56:24.714 --> 03:56:29.519
display is a user defined name.
You can use any function name here.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/9236-3
03:56:29.519 --> 03:56:33.476
So that's why we have changed display to
the show info.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/9236-4
03:56:33.476 --> 03:56:35.666
You can write the display also.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/9240-0
03:56:35.866 --> 03:56:40.906
So right the DSDISP I have right in one
example.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/9251-0
03:56:44.626 --> 03:56:48.946
Now here is 1 real time usage.
Should I show you?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/9274-0
03:56:50.266 --> 03:56:55.504
