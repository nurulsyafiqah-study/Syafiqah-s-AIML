1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10120-0
00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:10.490
OK, here as well.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10127-0
00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:17.410
It's required. You have to write it.
I forget to write.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10128-0
00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:18.570
OK.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10129-0
00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:21.610
No.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10137-0
00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:27.533
For example,
here you want to withdraw from this

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10137-1
00:13:27.533 --> 00:13:28.330
account.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10139-0
00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:37.490
Run this one.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10143-0
00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:40.090
Let me show you with one.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10147-0
00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:45.210
I have right here again.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10151-0
00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:48.810
This one object I'm writing.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10160-0
00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.250
So this one is here right now.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10164-0
00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.450
Withdraw amount. Let's see.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10165-0
00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:27.610
Mold.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10168-0
00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:31.810
The blue amount.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10171-0
00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:35.730
Is equal to plot.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10173-0
00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:41.690
We put.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10176-0
00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:47.170
Enter amount.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10178-0
00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:50.010
To withdraw.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10200-0
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:58.103
Whatever amount user have entered we have
assigned to this withdraw amount.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10200-1
00:14:58.103 --> 00:15:03.210
We will write here AC one dot withdraw
and that W amount.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10203-0
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:05.890
We have withdrawal.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10209-0
00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:12.250
OK, this one we have done what happened.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10223-0
00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:28.330
This one enter amount to withdraw.
I have entered let's say 20,000.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10251-0
00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:36.004
So balance after withdrawal is 20,000 -,
30,000 right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10251-1
00:15:36.004 --> 00:15:42.660
I have run it again and this time for
example I have entered 67,000 something.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10251-2
00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:47.210
So insufficient amount in account
transaction failed.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10253-0
00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:49.050
Got it.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10254-0
00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:51.050
Do it.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10268-0
00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:22.970
The amount is equal to withdraw amount,
right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10269-0
00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:29.690
Thank you.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10272-0
00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:43.850
Um.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10274-0
00:17:58.610 --> 00:17:59.210
Yeah.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10285-0
00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:59.530
Thank you.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10287-0
00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:09.610
Mhm.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10288-0
00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:20.250
You are.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10292-0
00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:43.930
OK.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10299-0
00:19:55.490 --> 00:20:00.410
I think.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10300-0
00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:15.610
Thank you.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10301-0
00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:18.010
Thank you.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10306-0
00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:30.010
See here one thing done up to this level.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10327-0
00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:30.090
OK.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10329-0
00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:44.010
I'm giving it.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10331-0
00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:57.290
Let me check.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10334-0
00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:10.810
Yeah.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10341-0
00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:18.810
Hmm. Uh, it says. Uh,
dependence versus pointy.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10391-0
00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:24.936
Polymorphism inheritance versus
polymorphism you are asking.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10391-1
00:23:24.936 --> 00:23:30.039
See inheritance is actually the
polymorphism is a part of inheritance

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10391-2
00:23:30.039 --> 00:23:33.829
only right?
See inheritance means you have the base

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10391-3
00:23:33.829 --> 00:23:39.733
class right? And you have the drive class.
So inheritance you it's inherited the

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10391-4
00:23:39.733 --> 00:23:40.170
value.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10433-0
00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:45.103
You can use it here right now.
You can use the multiple form on this one,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10433-1
00:23:45.103 --> 00:23:49.265
so that is known as method overriding.
We have the method here.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10433-2
00:23:49.265 --> 00:23:52.777
We want to override it,
so that is method overriding.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10433-3
00:23:52.777 --> 00:23:55.964
So that is polymorphous means method
overriding.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10433-4
00:23:55.964 --> 00:23:58.370
So the method you have override here.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10471-0
00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:02.655
See here, here is show info.
This is the main method.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10471-1
00:24:02.655 --> 00:24:06.939
Here we have overrided.
So this is method overriding.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10471-2
00:24:06.939 --> 00:24:10.748
This is inheritance.
This is method overriding.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10471-3
00:24:10.748 --> 00:24:15.033
So you mean that you can do multiple
overriding. Yes,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10471-4
00:24:15.033 --> 00:24:17.730
after this developer you have the.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10473-0
00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:19.410
So let's say.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10492-0
00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:24.023
App developer, right.
In the app developer you want to override

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10492-1
00:24:24.023 --> 00:24:26.981
it further. You can do it. OK, you can do.
OK, sure.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10492-2
00:24:26.981 --> 00:24:30.330
You can do one more layer and you need
the last one, right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10513-0
00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:40.110
This is the polymorphic,
the same method we have multiple form,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10513-1
00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:43.090
so that is polymorphic or method.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10538-0
00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:51.995
And we can also have the the one method
twice and all we can write with the

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10538-1
00:24:51.995 --> 00:24:54.992
different parameter.
That's method overloading.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10538-2
00:24:54.992 --> 00:24:56.490
Is it method overriding?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10539-0
00:24:59.050 --> 00:24:59.090
Uh.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10541-0
00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:01.730
Here it is.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10549-0
00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:50.490
Based on.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10550-0
00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:59.810
To the.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10564-0
00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:25.490
What you do is improve the graduate.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10568-0
00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:30.210
Yes, we don't know the problem.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10570-0
00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:33.530
Yes, sure.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10573-0
00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:37.770
I'm gonna miss.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10574-0
00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:41.930
Stop.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10593-0
00:26:51.850 --> 00:27:05.598
So guys, you can take the lunch break now.
Let me resolve that issue first.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10593-1
00:27:05.598 --> 00:27:08.130
What happened?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10594-0
00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:10.490
OK.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10618-0
00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:24.056
And #24 you see account and you're OK see
here this this one here you have two

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10618-1
00:27:24.056 --> 00:27:31.130
things right? So this is a string.
I will close it here.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10623-0
00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:36.490
And this is the value to write it like
this, it will correct.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10640-0
00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:48.446
So there is 2 value.
First one is the name, name is the string,

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10640-1
00:27:48.446 --> 00:27:53.650
the second one is the amount here.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10691-0
00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:58.896
So fine,
you can go for the lunch now and after

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10691-1
00:27:58.896 --> 00:28:05.710
one hour we will meet. All of you,
you can go for the lunch break now.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10691-2
00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:12.523
We will start at after one hour.
Do you have an issue? I just want to.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10691-3
00:28:12.523 --> 00:28:13.770
So this is a.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10703-0
00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:28.810
OK, so I don't, I don't enter anything.
So is that correct, Sir?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10709-0
00:28:58.210 --> 00:28:58.690
Mhm.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10710-0
00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:06.850
Actually, I think.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10713-0
00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:27.970
Send message.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10719-0
00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:36.290
And then also get things into it.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10720-0
00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:41.210
Home.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10749-0
00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:55.578
OK, so it's a lunch break.
After one hour we'll join all of you.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10749-1
00:29:55.578 --> 00:30:01.068
So online one also you guys can go for
the lunch break now. Fine.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/10749-2
00:30:01.068 --> 00:30:03.730
So 130 is 2:30 will start again.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11137-0
01:31:14.610 --> 01:31:20.170
Fine. Should we start now? OK,
all of you are here.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11144-0
01:31:22.610 --> 01:31:25.570
Online one also, are you there?
One of you.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11147-0
01:31:26.330 --> 01:31:28.210
Yes, Sir.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11146-0
01:31:26.970 --> 01:31:27.090
OK.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11149-0
01:31:28.850 --> 01:31:30.410
Fine. See here.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11156-0
01:31:34.250 --> 01:31:37.410
We were working on this particular
example.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11176-0
01:32:18.410 --> 01:32:21.530
This one we were working on, right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11177-0
01:32:24.250 --> 01:32:24.450
Here.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11187-0
01:32:25.610 --> 01:32:30.610
One thing I want to ask and after that I
will show you the solution also.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11189-0
01:32:36.130 --> 01:32:37.090
Here it is.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11193-0
01:32:47.210 --> 01:32:48.330
You terminally.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11201-0
01:32:59.890 --> 01:33:02.850
You have done it.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11203-0
01:33:06.850 --> 01:33:07.890
EX dot Y.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11207-0
01:33:13.690 --> 01:33:16.250
4000.5 euros.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11213-0
01:33:17.930 --> 01:33:20.090
So this is variance after window.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11243-0
01:33:21.130 --> 01:33:28.084
See here we want that the user can't
access this balance directly and change

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11243-1
01:33:28.084 --> 01:33:35.128
it from here from the outside, right?
So for example you are right AC one dot

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11243-2
01:33:35.128 --> 01:33:35.850
balance.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11269-0
01:33:36.370 --> 01:33:40.540
Plus equal to something is equal to 20,
000 something.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11269-1
01:33:40.540 --> 01:33:46.606
You have changed it or you have right
here 25 something something that we don't

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11269-2
01:33:46.606 --> 01:33:52.368
want that user can do this thing.
So for that we can use the encapsulation.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11269-3
01:33:52.368 --> 01:33:53.050
See here.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11272-0
01:33:59.370 --> 01:34:00.770
Whatever you have, right?

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11276-0
01:34:04.650 --> 01:34:06.850
It's how bad it is this thing here.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11316-0
01:34:07.930 --> 01:34:13.996
So 25,000 started in this one.
So we don't want that you can access this

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11316-1
01:34:13.996 --> 01:34:19.064
value directly. Fine.
You want you can access it through the

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11316-2
01:34:19.064 --> 01:34:23.634
method only.
So for that we can use the encapsulation.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11316-3
01:34:23.634 --> 01:34:26.210
We can encapsulate it inside a.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11342-0
01:34:26.330 --> 01:34:33.393
Member see here control PC. Got it.
What I showed you that we don't want to

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11342-1
01:34:33.393 --> 01:34:40.828
access this balance directly, right?
So for that we will use the encapsulation.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11342-2
01:34:40.828 --> 01:34:41.850
So here is.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11349-0
01:34:43.650 --> 01:34:47.210
Let me tell you the theory,
then we'll show you practically.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11391-0
01:34:50.730 --> 01:34:55.507
Encapsulation restricts direct access to
the object data.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11391-1
01:34:55.507 --> 01:34:59.708
We use private attribute and getter
setter method.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11391-2
01:34:59.708 --> 01:35:05.803
Getter is for returning the value.
Setter is for setting the value right.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11391-3
01:35:05.803 --> 01:35:10.250
So if you write only the get then you
can't directly.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11423-0
01:35:10.330 --> 01:35:15.647
Set the value to this one right.
For example you have to clear here the

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11423-1
01:35:15.647 --> 01:35:19.783
balance and you have right here def get
balance itself.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11423-2
01:35:19.783 --> 01:35:25.395
So here self balance is returning.
You can't set the value directly to this

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11423-3
01:35:25.395 --> 01:35:25.690
one.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11425-0
01:35:25.770 --> 01:35:27.450
So for example in the same.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11448-0
01:35:51.930 --> 01:35:57.384
You have a class this account.
For example you have account and you have

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11448-1
01:35:57.384 --> 01:36:00.970
self balance.
Balance is equal to balance gate.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11456-0
01:36:22.450 --> 01:36:24.130
Yeah, great to this one.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11465-0
01:36:25.530 --> 01:36:29.610
And the rest thing you have right the
same like you have right earlier.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11467-0
01:36:38.370 --> 01:36:39.570
AC holder.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11474-0
01:37:14.090 --> 01:37:17.370
Hold this version.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11476-0
01:37:19.370 --> 01:37:20.210
AC holder.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11487-0
01:37:25.050 --> 01:37:28.904
You can write the same also if you want,
just to avoid the confusion.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11487-1
01:37:28.904 --> 01:37:30.170
You can write the same.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11493-0
01:37:51.530 --> 01:37:54.010
No, here it is. Uh.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11495-0
01:37:56.170 --> 01:37:57.250
We have right.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11515-0
01:37:58.970 --> 01:38:03.817
If you want to write the same,
you can write the same. No need to worry.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11515-1
01:38:03.817 --> 01:38:08.530
So here is we have created the account.
You have write AC dot balance.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11526-0
01:38:10.970 --> 01:38:17.010
Is equal to something, let's say 34,
000 something. We'll go here.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11530-0
01:38:18.610 --> 01:38:20.170
We would terminate.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11532-0
01:38:27.650 --> 01:38:27.810
And.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11534-0
01:38:30.370 --> 01:38:31.130
Fearless.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11536-0
01:38:35.890 --> 01:38:36.050
See you.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11545-0
01:38:41.010 --> 01:38:45.613
Account holder.
He will pass from here the account holder

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11545-1
01:38:45.613 --> 01:38:46.010

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11546-0
01:38:49.570 --> 01:38:49.730
So.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11550-0
01:38:52.570 --> 01:38:55.330

01:39:02.090 --> 01:39:03.730
We have done this one.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11554-0
01:39:07.730 --> 01:39:08.050

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11558-0
01:39:11.730 --> 01:39:13.410
See it auto balance.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11563-0
01:39:24.530 --> 01:39:26.090

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11564-0
01:39:27.850 --> 01:39:28.610
Unis.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11567-0
01:39:32.250 --> 01:39:33.330
34,000.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11570-0
01:39:38.890 --> 01:39:40.490
If you have right here.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11577-0
01:39:57.690 --> 01:39:59.490
And you have tried to access the.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11584-0
01:40:05.210 --> 01:40:09.970
Valance is equal to this one.
We'll go here view terminal.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11585-0
01:40:16.450 --> 01:40:16.610
So.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11586-0
01:40:18.330 --> 01:40:18.610
Yes.

1dad3755-baa0-4cec-8faa-6e1d5810f16b/11590-0
01:40:25.290 --> 01:40:26.290
You tell me.

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/55-0
01:40:38.157 --> 01:40:42.117
34,
000 so it's the same thing whether you

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/55-1
01:40:42.117 --> 01:40:47.734
will write this way.
So here is we can take the value and we

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/55-2
01:40:47.734 --> 01:40:53.904
can pass using the getter,
get the balance will return the balance

3ed754cb-8e9d-4530-83e9-6cf536dcb477/55-3
01:40:53.904 --> 01:40:55.837
to self self balance.
