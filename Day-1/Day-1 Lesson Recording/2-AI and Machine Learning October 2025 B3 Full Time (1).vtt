00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:09.101
Control KC for commit.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12390-0
00:00:13.781 --> 00:00:20.141
K for king, C for cat.
Oh control KC control KC.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12391-0
00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:21.421
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12399-0
00:00:22.581 --> 00:00:28.781
I see it will become hashtags, right?
Comment, comment.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12418-0
00:00:30.341 --> 00:00:34.528
To comment all the things.
Now it is commented right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12418-1
00:00:34.528 --> 00:00:39.101
It will not execute.
Now if you run it again, see nothing.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12457-0
00:00:40.461 --> 00:00:45.567
Right. So now we have comment.
We are going to write here only one more

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12457-1
00:00:45.567 --> 00:00:49.041
program.
So the earlier program we don't want to

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12457-2
00:00:49.041 --> 00:00:53.083
use, just I comment it.
You can read out later on. Fine.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12457-3
00:00:53.083 --> 00:00:56.061
So now I'm going to write here, let's say.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12459-0
00:00:58.781 --> 00:01:00.221
Here it is.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12460-0
00:01:02.421 --> 00:01:03.581
No one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12462-0
00:01:04.341 --> 00:01:05.181
Is equal to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12466-0
00:01:06.861 --> 00:01:09.061
Uh, we have rate input.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12471-0
00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:12.781
First number what do we have right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12472-0
00:01:14.581 --> 00:01:15.541
First number.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12476-0
00:01:17.341 --> 00:01:20.061
Then we are at number 2.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12478-0
00:01:22.301 --> 00:01:22.861
Input.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12480-0
00:01:26.781 --> 00:01:27.981
Second number.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12506-0
00:01:29.861 --> 00:01:37.088
So we are going to discuss the operator,
arithmetic operator rate plus minus

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12506-1
00:01:37.088 --> 00:01:44.126
multiply. You all know that means.
So here we are rate sum is equal to num

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12506-2
00:01:44.126 --> 00:01:44.501
one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12526-0
00:01:46.421 --> 00:01:54.298
Plus NUM 2 what it will do it will add
both the numbers number one and NUM 2

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12526-1
00:01:54.298 --> 00:01:59.821
plus means it will add this one.
So here is so print.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12530-0
00:02:05.741 --> 00:02:08.581
Result after adding.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12531-0
00:02:10.701 --> 00:02:11.741
No one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12534-0
00:02:13.301 --> 00:02:15.221
And #2.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12541-0
00:02:19.781 --> 00:02:25.101
Is equal to Vexel St. so.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12585-0
00:02:33.061 --> 00:02:37.030
Let me explain what it will do.
See all of you the online.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12585-1
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.008
Also we have right here number one.
We are going to take the first number

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12585-2
00:02:42.008 --> 00:02:45.304
from the user.
Whatever number user will insert,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12585-3
00:02:45.304 --> 00:02:48.869
it will store inside this number one
variable right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12585-4
00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:52.501
Then the second number whatever the user
will insert.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12617-0
00:02:52.821 --> 00:02:57.055
It will store inside the the second one,
the num two.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12617-1
00:02:57.055 --> 00:03:02.778
We have declare here sum so we will add
the first number and 2nd number.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12617-2
00:03:02.778 --> 00:03:08.501
So whatever the result of adding first
and 2nd it will store inside sum.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12620-0
00:03:09.581 --> 00:03:12.621
Right. You can write some more.
Let me write result.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12656-0
00:03:13.621 --> 00:03:17.317
Just the result.
So it will show inside the result.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12656-1
00:03:17.317 --> 00:03:22.932
We want to display here the result right?
So we have rated result after adding

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12656-2
00:03:22.932 --> 00:03:27.481
number one and Num 2 is equal to whatever
the result will come.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12656-3
00:03:27.481 --> 00:03:30.821
So here what we have rate Python taking
input.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12686-0
00:03:31.221 --> 00:03:38.462
Let me just write here 4 and here I write
5 so result after. OK, I got it.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12686-1
00:03:38.462 --> 00:03:43.772
CLS let will be so because these are the
string right.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12680-0
00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:43.101
What now, who should be?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12686-2
00:03:43.772 --> 00:03:46.861
We want number so you write int.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12692-0
00:03:52.741 --> 00:03:55.541
You have to convert to the integer, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12700-0
00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:05.381
Otherwise it'll be concatenate the
strings. So here is.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12721-0
00:04:07.341 --> 00:04:15.221
First number is let's say 34,
second number is 12, so 34 and 12 is 46.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12728-0
00:04:25.141 --> 00:04:29.101
So this this is adding two numbers.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12744-0
00:04:36.501 --> 00:04:41.726
You can take any 2 numbers and it will
add these two numbers and give you the

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12744-1
00:04:41.726 --> 00:04:42.261
results.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12746-0
00:04:43.741 --> 00:04:44.261
Got it.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12774-0
00:05:04.141 --> 00:05:12.832
This one is F everyone bring F You see
this one is this F is for formatting.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12774-1
00:05:12.832 --> 00:05:18.701
See we want this. Let me remove this.
Here is view.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12808-0
00:05:31.541 --> 00:05:39.072
See what it say. Num one and Num 2 result.
You see this output right now without F

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12808-1
00:05:39.072 --> 00:05:44.788
So what we want to do,
we want to inform it that the take is a

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12808-2
00:05:44.788 --> 00:05:46.421
formatting things.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12868-0
00:05:46.941 --> 00:05:50.439
The format will take.
So whatever we have right in curly braces,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12868-1
00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:54.529
it will show the value of that one.
It will show you the value of that one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12868-2
00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:58.834
It will show you the value of that one.
It will show you the value of that one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12868-3
00:05:58.834 --> 00:06:02.816
So here in place of number one,
it will show you the value of number one,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12868-4
00:06:02.816 --> 00:06:06.421
that is the number you have entered.
For example you have entered.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12889-0
00:06:06.621 --> 00:06:11.682
34 so it will show you the 34 and
whatever 12 so it will show you the 12.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12889-1
00:06:11.682 --> 00:06:17.221
If you will not write F it will show you
number one and number two three yes so.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12913-0
00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:23.361
F is for formatting this.
So here the first number for example you

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12913-1
00:06:23.361 --> 00:06:27.393
have right five.
Now you have read the second number you

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12913-2
00:06:27.393 --> 00:06:31.142
are right 12.
So here the format result after adding

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12913-3
00:06:31.142 --> 00:06:32.981
five and 12 is 17. Got it.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12940-0
00:06:38.461 --> 00:06:42.626
I'm running it again.
The first number I have entered,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12940-1
00:06:42.626 --> 00:06:46.866
let's say 13.
The second number I have entered here 56.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12940-2
00:06:46.866 --> 00:06:51.181
So here's the result after adding 13 and
56 is this one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12941-0
00:06:52.981 --> 00:06:53.381
Right.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12955-0
00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:59.549
And if you want, once you are writing,
you want some spaces,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12955-1
00:06:59.549 --> 00:07:02.341
so you can write this way back slash T.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12960-0
00:07:04.621 --> 00:07:07.901
Right, so if you run it now.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12975-0
00:07:16.621 --> 00:07:22.321
First number 55,
second number is 15 and the result after

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12975-1
00:07:22.321 --> 00:07:24.581
adding 45 and 15 is 60.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12989-0
00:08:18.461 --> 00:08:18.941
Mhm.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12990-0
00:08:27.221 --> 00:08:27.621
Good.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12992-0
00:08:30.821 --> 00:08:32.261
Done all of you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13010-0
00:08:34.821 --> 00:08:40.377
No issue, no issue. We'll take your time.
In case you're stuck somewhere,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13010-1
00:08:40.377 --> 00:08:44.881
you need any help,
you can ask or if it's OK, you'll do it.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13010-2
00:08:44.881 --> 00:08:45.181
See.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13012-0
00:08:49.461 --> 00:08:50.341
Yes, please.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13019-0
00:09:05.341 --> 00:09:07.261
For that, for this.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13073-0
00:09:08.821 --> 00:09:14.216
OK, OK I I got it. What you are asking.
See here the command that we already have

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13073-1
00:09:14.216 --> 00:09:16.979
used.
We can use here the up key the your

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13073-2
00:09:16.979 --> 00:09:22.045
keyboard have these arrow, up arrow,
down arrow, right. So use the up arrow.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13073-3
00:09:22.045 --> 00:09:26.781
This up arrow you will show you the
command that you already have used.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13088-0
00:09:27.341 --> 00:09:32.441
Right last you have you so you write here.
For example I'm writing here the Python

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13088-1
00:09:32.441 --> 00:09:35.021
taking enter so I need not write it again.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13140-0
00:09:36.101 --> 00:09:39.144
You got it.
So because we already have read that

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13140-1
00:09:39.144 --> 00:09:42.311
command,
we just press the app key so it will give

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13140-2
00:09:42.311 --> 00:09:45.912
you the command.
For example this CLS clear scanner view.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13140-3
00:09:45.912 --> 00:09:49.638
So it's all cleared.
Now I've used the app key that it will

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13140-4
00:09:49.638 --> 00:09:54.606
come out the Python taking input by here
we have read the first number so every

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13140-5
00:09:54.606 --> 00:09:55.661
time you have no.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13153-0
00:09:55.861 --> 00:10:00.214
Write it again and again.
You already have type it so you can use

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13153-1
00:10:00.214 --> 00:10:03.577
it from right?
Thanks for this question because it

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13153-2
00:10:03.577 --> 00:10:05.621
really helps to others as well.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13178-0
00:10:15.821 --> 00:10:24.208
Then after this means all of you done up
to this level. Yes, you already.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13178-1
00:10:24.208 --> 00:10:30.781
So if if you want to do the see what I'm
doing is I have.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13179-0
00:10:30.901 --> 00:10:30.941
Uh.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13215-0
00:10:33.181 --> 00:10:36.374
Copy it.
To copy you press control C and to

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13215-1
00:10:36.374 --> 00:10:41.670
comment you will press control KC.
So I have copied and I have pasted it

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13215-2
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:45.152
here again.
Control C If you want to multiply 2

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13215-3
00:10:45.152 --> 00:10:47.981
number what do we want to do? Multiply.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13241-0
00:10:48.461 --> 00:10:52.873
So what we have to do in this case
multiply 2 numbers.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13241-1
00:10:52.873 --> 00:10:58.728
This time I want to multiply fuzzy.
I want to multiply these two number.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13225-0
00:10:55.541 --> 00:10:55.661
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13241-2
00:10:58.728 --> 00:11:03.701
I have asked enter the first number,
enter the second number.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13243-0
00:11:04.581 --> 00:11:06.221
And result after.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13257-0
00:11:07.181 --> 00:11:11.243
Multiplication.
Multiplication is equal to this one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13257-1
00:11:11.243 --> 00:11:15.381
So what we have to do where we have to do
the change?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13288-0
00:11:16.701 --> 00:11:21.213
Any idea I'm asking to you see this this
one? Yes,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13288-1
00:11:21.213 --> 00:11:28.380
this one is the plus is place of this one.
We'll write this asterisk the star so

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13264-0
00:11:21.701 --> 00:11:22.181
Mhm.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13288-2
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.741
that will it will multiply the number.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13336-0
00:11:32.061 --> 00:11:36.654
We are taking the first number,
we are taking the second number and we

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13336-1
00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:40.017
have multiplied.
So the first one is your addition.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13336-2
00:11:40.017 --> 00:11:43.380
This plus sign is addition.
This is multiplication.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13336-3
00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:47.713
So now ELSI have run it again.
So first number we have right here,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13336-4
00:11:47.713 --> 00:11:51.141
let's say 12.
The second number I have right here 5.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13322-0
00:11:49.501 --> 00:11:49.701
Yes.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13352-0
00:11:51.781 --> 00:12:00.453
So here the result after multiplication
is 12 into 5 is equal to 60. Got it.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13352-1
00:12:00.453 --> 00:12:07.661
So once I resolve it's not blue.
Sorry your result is not blue.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13354-0
00:12:07.861 --> 00:12:11.301
But your program is working.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13368-0
00:12:13.621 --> 00:12:19.461
Number one and #2 is blue but but result
is not blue in your one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13365-0
00:12:17.741 --> 00:12:18.221
Mhm.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13367-0
00:12:19.261 --> 00:12:19.781
Yes.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13374-0
00:12:21.981 --> 00:12:25.781
Is your program is working or not working?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13373-0
00:12:23.301 --> 00:12:23.461
No.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13392-0
00:12:26.941 --> 00:12:31.441
I will come in. So we'll do it.
So you got it. The multiplication.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13392-1
00:12:31.441 --> 00:12:36.141
If you want to multiply, we will do this.
This is the multiplication.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13391-0
00:12:34.021 --> 00:12:34.501
Mhm.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13393-0
00:12:37.101 --> 00:12:37.461
Good.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13407-0
00:12:40.661 --> 00:12:46.741
So you are running because you have the
wrong parenthesis. It should be.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13405-0
00:12:43.181 --> 00:12:44.181
What does me?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13406-0
00:12:46.421 --> 00:12:46.901
Mhm.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13409-0
00:12:59.301 --> 00:13:00.261
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13410-0
00:13:03.981 --> 00:13:09.261
This will this will.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13429-0
00:13:10.461 --> 00:13:14.743
You have to do this way,
but it is this one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13429-1
00:13:14.743 --> 00:13:21.214
Is that another difference?
This one is this one. This is probably.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13429-2
00:13:21.214 --> 00:13:25.781
Thank you.
So in the multiply you will do what?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13431-0
00:13:26.221 --> 00:13:30.101
Oh, they might.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13466-0
00:13:31.981 --> 00:13:42.606
I still get the multiplication.
I already put like this,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13438-0
00:13:32.301 --> 00:13:32.781
Thank you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13466-1
00:13:42.606 --> 00:13:50.061
multiply the number and then I put this.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13463-0
00:13:46.341 --> 00:13:46.901
Yes.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13482-0
00:13:50.661 --> 00:14:00.141
We'll have to change everything they
should have doing the same.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13483-0
00:14:00.861 --> 00:14:01.141
Sensions.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13514-0
00:14:01.781 --> 00:14:06.209
Sorry, you said.
So if I want to generate this,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13486-0
00:14:03.501 --> 00:14:03.621
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13514-1
00:14:06.209 --> 00:14:12.112
can you teach me that?
I want to generate the first, the first.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13498-0
00:14:09.661 --> 00:14:09.781
Right.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13514-2
00:14:12.112 --> 00:14:18.661
I have to. I did it right. Let's see.
What do you have? Just a minute.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13518-0
00:14:18.901 --> 00:14:22.061
I want you to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13521-0
00:14:25.581 --> 00:14:31.379
You want to generate the data? Yeah,
the data. Yeah, it's data. Well,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13521-1
00:14:31.379 --> 00:14:32.621
you don't copy.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13526-0
00:14:39.461 --> 00:14:43.981
This one is it's working right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13531-0
00:15:06.341 --> 00:15:06.541
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13537-0
00:15:08.821 --> 00:15:16.381
We do want it to,
so it is done by the first.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13538-0
00:15:19.621 --> 00:15:20.141
Yeah.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13539-0
00:15:20.861 --> 00:15:21.021

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13547-0
00:15:23.741 --> 00:15:26.661
PY wish, PY wish.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13548-0
00:15:28.141 --> 00:15:28.301
So.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13552-0
00:15:31.541 --> 00:15:34.621
You want to teach your ad, right?
Then put it.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13553-0
00:15:35.821 --> 00:15:37.021
We can do that.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13554-0
00:15:43.541 --> 00:15:43.741
Yes.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13575-0
00:15:46.341 --> 00:15:52.159
So I copy key.
I think this is the first number.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13575-1
00:15:52.159 --> 00:16:01.181
This is the second number, right?
I have to just just what is this sub key?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13579-0
00:16:02.701 --> 00:16:17.981
OK. OK. OK. So let's see. OK, maybe 6K.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13577-0
00:16:16.181 --> 00:16:16.301
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13586-0
00:16:18.701 --> 00:16:27.381
So you've been thinking what it's not so
I have to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13597-0
00:16:31.421 --> 00:16:35.981
OK, this. OK, this.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13600-0
00:16:46.741 --> 00:16:49.941
Control C Control PC.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13601-0
00:16:51.701 --> 00:17:06.381
She and see.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13618-0
00:17:06.701 --> 00:17:14.315
So,
so I have to put down the online paper.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13618-1
00:17:14.315 --> 00:17:22.621
So I have to put the where do you want to
pass?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13622-0
00:17:22.981 --> 00:17:25.901

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13636-0
00:17:27.541 --> 00:17:35.277
And the right case,
so just change this +2 stop.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13636-1
00:17:35.277 --> 00:17:42.381
So I have no place to start and just
change.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13639-0
00:17:45.581 --> 00:17:46.741

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13669-1
00:18:40.721 --> 00:18:42.061
green.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13679-0
00:18:44.221 --> 00:18:53.861
Go and bring it, rewrite it and comment.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13683-0
00:19:03.021 --> 00:19:03.341
Yeah.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13684-0
00:19:05.621 --> 00:19:07.981
I'm angry.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13685-0
00:19:09.821 --> 00:19:10.301
Mhm.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13715-0
00:19:11.501 --> 00:19:16.609
OK, so you have seen the multiplication,
you have seen the this one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13715-1
00:19:16.609 --> 00:19:22.382
Similarly you have if you have the
division, you will leave the division one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13715-2
00:19:22.382 --> 00:19:27.341
Let me show you just you have copy this
one controls. Let me just.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13718-0
00:19:30.621 --> 00:19:32.061
Control C.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13730-0
00:19:33.141 --> 00:19:37.740
Control C copy Control KC.
I have commented this and I have pasted

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13730-1
00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:38.701
it here again.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13734-0
00:19:40.301 --> 00:19:42.661
Uh, Control V here is.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13737-0
00:19:44.381 --> 00:19:46.101
Division example.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13746-0
00:19:49.421 --> 00:19:55.541
Division example you want to divide the
number #1 #2 result.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13751-0
00:19:57.061 --> 00:20:00.661
Here is a NUM 1 by NUM 2 result after.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13753-0
00:20:04.781 --> 00:20:05.981
Dividing.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13755-0
00:20:12.301 --> 00:20:14.261
Number one by.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13756-0
00:20:14.941 --> 00:20:15.461
Nam 2.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13758-0
00:20:17.061 --> 00:20:17.181
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13765-0
00:20:36.941 --> 00:20:38.461
Oh, this one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13774-0
00:20:40.181 --> 00:20:43.061
This is known as arithmetic operator.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13811-0
00:20:45.061 --> 00:20:49.561
This is these are operators,
arithmetic operator plus minus multiply

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13811-1
00:20:49.561 --> 00:20:54.321
division, right? So the division you want.
So see here the first number,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13811-2
00:20:54.321 --> 00:20:57.647
second number.
You have divide the first number by

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13811-3
00:20:57.647 --> 00:21:00.581
second number.
You'll go here view terminal.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13849-0
00:21:02.021 --> 00:21:06.783
Done this one you can do will go your
view terminal.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13849-1
00:21:06.783 --> 00:21:13.162
So here let me just run it again.
First number I have it, let's say 6.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13849-2
00:21:13.162 --> 00:21:19.541
The second number I write 2.
So the result after dividing 6 by 2 is 3.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13853-0
00:21:20.861 --> 00:21:23.901
Right. Shall we do it fast?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13858-0
00:21:47.181 --> 00:21:47.421
Yeah.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13860-0
00:21:55.981 --> 00:21:56.301
Yeah.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13861-0
00:22:03.621 --> 00:22:04.101
Mhm.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13872-0
00:22:11.581 --> 00:22:17.741
With an example now one more if you want
to find out the uh this one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13879-0
00:22:19.381 --> 00:22:24.741
Reminder I will find out. So here is.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13891-0
00:22:26.101 --> 00:22:30.035
Done this one, Dave. Example.
Dave is in one control KC.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13891-1
00:22:30.035 --> 00:22:32.381
I have commented. I paste it here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13894-0
00:22:35.061 --> 00:22:36.381
Uh, here is it.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13899-0
00:22:51.501 --> 00:22:52.941
Finding.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13905-0
00:22:55.661 --> 00:22:58.181
Right. So yeah, the first number,
second number.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13907-0
00:22:59.741 --> 00:23:00.461
Here it is.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13915-0
00:23:12.421 --> 00:23:18.501
Remainder after dividing num one by num 2.
So here is.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13938-0
00:23:21.701 --> 00:23:27.570
Taking input first number 34,
second number is 6,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13938-1
00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:32.381
so 6 / 30 words 65 the 30 remaining is 4.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13964-0
00:23:41.461 --> 00:23:46.454
Let's say 21 / 5.
So 21 we have divided by 5,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13946-0
00:23:44.741 --> 00:23:45.541
Listen.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13964-1
00:23:46.454 --> 00:23:54.919
the remaining is the remaining right?
So for that we will use this percentile

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13964-2
00:23:54.919 --> 00:23:55.461
sign.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13971-0
00:24:02.221 --> 00:24:05.837
Do it.
Then I will show you one more thing.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13971-1
00:24:05.837 --> 00:24:06.741
Do it fast.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13972-0
00:24:11.101 --> 00:24:11.221
Yes.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13973-0
00:24:11.381 --> 00:24:11.821
Hmm.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13978-0
00:24:18.261 --> 00:24:20.501
And check. Oh, OK, you can.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13980-0
00:24:37.821 --> 00:24:37.941
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13982-0
00:24:40.261 --> 00:24:40.461
Hello.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13983-0
00:24:40.541 --> 00:24:40.661
Yes.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/13991-0
00:24:43.661 --> 00:24:48.061
With us, your mic is on.
Are you asking anything?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14014-0
00:24:48.501 --> 00:24:54.630
Yes,
I want to ask for the division example

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14002-0
00:24:48.981 --> 00:24:52.461
If you are asking, yes please.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14014-1
00:24:54.630 --> 00:25:00.341
why the result is in floating number 3.0.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14003-0
00:24:54.861 --> 00:24:55.381
Mhm.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14016-0
00:25:03.141 --> 00:25:03.621
Mhm.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14031-0
00:25:03.581 --> 00:25:06.341
Because the result we have not declare
any data type,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14031-1
00:25:06.341 --> 00:25:08.181
so it will take you the default one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14028-0
00:25:08.261 --> 00:25:08.301
Oh.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14045-0
00:25:11.141 --> 00:25:15.614
If you want, if you want integer,
you have to convert it to the integer,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14038-0
00:25:11.861 --> 00:25:12.541
Oh, OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14045-1
00:25:15.614 --> 00:25:15.981
right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14046-0
00:25:16.421 --> 00:25:16.981
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14057-0
00:25:18.461 --> 00:25:23.821
Uh, usually for floating number. Uh,
it will show how many decimal places.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14058-0
00:25:25.621 --> 00:25:25.821
Right.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14077-0
00:25:26.581 --> 00:25:28.608
The floating number it will give you
right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14077-1
00:25:28.608 --> 00:25:30.819
Because we have divided the integer by
integer,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14077-2
00:25:30.819 --> 00:25:32.661
so it will give you the floating number.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14111-0
00:25:34.541 --> 00:25:39.032
If you want only an integer,
so you have to convert it to the int.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14084-0
00:25:37.021 --> 00:25:37.501
Mhm.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14111-1
00:25:39.032 --> 00:25:43.388
Here you can write int.
For example this one you write int so it

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14111-2
00:25:43.388 --> 00:25:48.950
will be integer only in the division you
will write before that int so it will not

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14103-0
00:25:46.581 --> 00:25:46.741
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14107-0
00:25:48.821 --> 00:25:48.941
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14111-3
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:49.821
give you 3.1.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14113-0
00:25:49.821 --> 00:25:51.421
Let me show you that.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14115-0
00:25:51.381 --> 00:25:51.501
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14114-0
00:25:52.381 --> 00:25:52.541
Just.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14140-0
00:25:53.901 --> 00:26:01.603
This one is reminder.
I have command to this control KC and

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14140-1
00:26:01.603 --> 00:26:11.101
there is control CI am writing it control
V You have command to this one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14144-0
00:26:12.141 --> 00:26:13.141
Control.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14180-0
00:26:15.061 --> 00:26:23.435
See see right now see saying that it's
showing here is the first number you have

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14180-1
00:26:23.435 --> 00:26:30.981
right 6 / 2. It's giving 3.0 right 3.0.
You want this three only so end.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14214-0
00:26:31.421 --> 00:26:35.021
You have right here.
Now you have run the same thing.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14214-1
00:26:35.021 --> 00:26:38.488
Here is the first number 6,
the second number is 3,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14214-2
00:26:38.488 --> 00:26:42.421
so here is the two, right?
It's not to give you that zero.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14214-3
00:26:42.421 --> 00:26:47.621
You can run it again. For example,
first number is 6, the second number is 2.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14249-0
00:26:48.301 --> 00:26:53.782
This is 3 if you want an integer, got it?
The default it will be in the decimal.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14227-0
00:26:53.101 --> 00:26:53.581
Yes.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14249-1
00:26:53.782 --> 00:26:57.909
If you don't want the decimal point,
you want to convert it,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14249-2
00:26:57.909 --> 00:27:00.141
so you have to write it this way.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14245-0
00:27:00.221 --> 00:27:00.421
Yes.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14273-0
00:27:01.021 --> 00:27:06.711
He have asked one question too that's the
answer of that question.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14273-1
00:27:06.711 --> 00:27:13.760
So let me just comment this control KC.
So these guys are doing this reminder one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14273-2
00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:17.581
So you will complete this please control
KC.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14276-0
00:27:29.621 --> 00:27:29.741
Yeah.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14287-0
00:28:17.421 --> 00:28:17.581
8.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14288-0
00:28:20.541 --> 00:28:21.021
Thank you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14289-0
00:28:24.541 --> 00:28:27.861
It's probably OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14295-0
00:28:52.021 --> 00:28:52.341
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14296-0
00:28:56.661 --> 00:28:56.901
Yes.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14297-0
00:29:01.621 --> 00:29:02.101
This evening.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14301-0
00:29:11.501 --> 00:29:13.301
Then all of you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14307-0
00:29:15.421 --> 00:29:18.701
Yes or no if you don't want.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14311-0
00:29:26.421 --> 00:29:28.421
Then this one you saw no.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14314-0
00:29:32.741 --> 00:29:33.301
I'm going slow.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14337-0
00:29:34.621 --> 00:29:48.215
Huh. No, no. What happened? Hello.
Syntax error. Syntax error. What error?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14337-1
00:29:48.215 --> 00:29:52.021
Syntax error. Syntax.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14349-0
00:29:52.221 --> 00:30:03.333
I already opened this and I just changed
the review. Now I want to set up screen.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14349-1
00:30:03.333 --> 00:30:09.701
Yeah, that's it. That's it. Sorry. Oh, oh,
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14350-0
00:30:11.221 --> 00:30:12.341
Chin picture.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14354-0
00:30:16.501 --> 00:30:19.741
So I have to call to CK, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14355-0
00:30:22.821 --> 00:30:40.581
I'm sorry. I like this. I like this.
I like this. OK, so.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14366-0
00:30:41.941 --> 00:30:58.901
Oh, we press it double. OK, I I like it.
I did try. OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14370-0
00:31:02.341 --> 00:31:15.021
Oh, sorry.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14371-0
00:31:19.581 --> 00:31:34.661
I don't have to do that. I don't think,
but to possibly.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14376-0
00:31:38.301 --> 00:31:48.101
I'll find what you're doing.
It lets me do it then.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14389-0
00:31:49.061 --> 00:31:56.867
OK,
I'll give you some reminders that you

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14389-1
00:31:56.867 --> 00:32:04.301
have divided number by the number, just.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14411-0
00:32:04.901 --> 00:32:08.295
12 Uh, I want to divide it into five.
I see.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14411-1
00:32:08.295 --> 00:32:14.028
So that means the number cannot be
created from the number that you want to

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14411-2
00:32:14.028 --> 00:32:20.061
provide, right? Right. OK, I understand.
I understand. I can make sure. OK, uh.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14432-0
00:32:24.541 --> 00:32:29.245
See here one question I'm going to ask
you now.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14432-1
00:32:29.245 --> 00:32:34.341
See here I'm going to take 2 numbers from
the user.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14452-0
00:32:36.301 --> 00:32:40.870
Fine.
So how we will do if you want to write it

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14452-1
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:45.248
in one line so we can write this one as
well.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14452-2
00:32:45.248 --> 00:32:50.101
So let me write here taking two numbers
in taking.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14463-0
00:32:53.621 --> 00:33:02.181
More than one input and this is the
example of taking one more than one input.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14480-0
00:33:05.781 --> 00:33:12.101
Using single line more than one input.
For example we want to take num one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14482-0
00:33:13.701 --> 00:33:14.221
Numb 2.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14485-0
00:33:16.101 --> 00:33:17.581
Here we write.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14487-0
00:33:19.461 --> 00:33:19.821
Input.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14489-0
00:33:22.941 --> 00:33:23.261
Enter.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14491-0
00:33:29.861 --> 00:33:30.901
2 numbers.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14494-0
00:33:32.421 --> 00:33:34.261
Separated.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14497-0
00:33:36.021 --> 00:33:37.661
By space.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14502-0
00:33:41.301 --> 00:33:43.901
Omar, we have right here spilled.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14506-0
00:33:45.341 --> 00:33:47.621
What do I write? Spilled.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14510-0
00:33:49.821 --> 00:33:53.061
Here is the print.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14511-0
00:33:56.781 --> 00:33:57.101
Number.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14515-0
00:33:59.541 --> 00:34:04.421
Entered by group R.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14517-0
00:34:06.701 --> 00:34:08.021
Number one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14518-0
00:34:10.341 --> 00:34:10.541
And.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14520-0
00:34:11.661 --> 00:34:12.101
#2

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14521-0
00:34:18.741 --> 00:34:19.101
Numbers.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14524-0
00:34:25.941 --> 00:34:26.941
Here it is.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14534-0
00:34:45.741 --> 00:34:49.501
It is your less.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14539-0
00:34:52.261 --> 00:34:54.461
Here we want to do this one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14563-0
00:34:56.261 --> 00:35:00.394
So here's the first we have run the
program.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14563-1
00:35:00.394 --> 00:35:07.741
First number we have rate 45 space 56.
So numbers entered by you are 45 and 56.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14562-0
00:35:07.101 --> 00:35:07.661
Mhm.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14579-0
00:35:29.501 --> 00:35:33.485
So we can take the multiple numbers in
one go,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14579-1
00:35:33.485 --> 00:35:36.621
for example 2345 as many as you want.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14591-0
00:35:42.421 --> 00:35:45.344
You write first number,
you write the space,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14591-1
00:35:45.344 --> 00:35:48.461
you write the second number, right?
Got it? No.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14644-0
00:35:49.741 --> 00:35:53.579
OK, done. First we'll do it.
So what we have want number one and

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14644-1
00:35:53.579 --> 00:35:58.421
number two enter 2 numbers separated by
space and then we have used the split and

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14644-2
00:35:58.421 --> 00:36:02.081
the numbers you have entered.
For example we have run it now.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14644-3
00:36:02.081 --> 00:36:05.210
So here the first number we have read,
let's say 55.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14644-4
00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:09.461
Then we have read the space and I have
read the 12. So first number is.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14647-0
00:36:09.541 --> 00:36:11.581
55 and second number is 12.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14648-0
00:36:18.101 --> 00:36:18.301
2.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14656-0
00:36:19.301 --> 00:36:22.701
Sir,
should we put integer before the input?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14670-0
00:36:23.341 --> 00:36:26.744
Yes,
if you want to to take then integer only,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14670-1
00:36:26.744 --> 00:36:30.581
it's this time it's taking the string
format, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14674-0
00:36:33.861 --> 00:36:36.741
You want integer right here int.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14676-0
00:36:38.221 --> 00:36:38.821
This is.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14677-0
00:36:42.661 --> 00:36:42.941
Indig.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14685-0
00:36:48.581 --> 00:36:52.981
Here is the integer.
It's not converting it.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14692-0
00:36:54.261 --> 00:36:58.301
This one is just the string form it will
take spread.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14708-0
00:37:00.741 --> 00:37:03.594
Now if you want to convert,
you can take the number,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14708-1
00:37:03.594 --> 00:37:06.501
you can convert it to integer and do the
calculation.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14709-0
00:37:07.661 --> 00:37:07.861
Right.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14711-0
00:37:19.581 --> 00:37:20.141
Plus.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14714-0
00:37:23.901 --> 00:37:25.301
And number.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14718-0
00:37:30.861 --> 00:37:32.141
You want to do the result?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14719-0
00:37:40.421 --> 00:37:41.701
And.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14723-0
00:37:47.501 --> 00:37:50.781
Addition of numbers.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14726-0
00:37:52.661 --> 00:37:55.141
We have right here result.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14730-0
00:37:57.261 --> 00:37:58.221
Is it fine now?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14732-0
00:37:59.901 --> 00:38:00.461
See this.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14735-0
00:38:01.981 --> 00:38:03.901
And the two numbers 34.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14736-0
00:38:05.541 --> 00:38:06.621
123.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14742-0
00:38:08.301 --> 00:38:10.941
OK, if you want to do this,
you can do that.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14753-0
00:38:12.381 --> 00:38:18.472
We don't need to do the input,
so you can take multiple numbers in one

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/14753-1
00:38:18.472 --> 00:38:18.901
book.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16358-0
02:13:40.301 --> 02:13:44.001
Rebecc,
all of you see we we were discussing

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16358-1
02:13:44.001 --> 02:13:50.661
about the input and simultaneously we
have seen the operators. So the operators,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16358-2
02:13:50.661 --> 02:13:56.581
we have the arithmetic operators.
So arithmetic operators we have seen.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16379-0
02:13:56.861 --> 02:14:02.706
Plus, minus, asterix and division, right?
And we have seen one more,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16379-1
02:14:02.706 --> 02:14:07.111
the modulus that is giving you the
reminder, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16379-2
02:14:07.111 --> 02:14:09.821
So these operators we have seen.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16380-0
02:14:11.021 --> 02:14:11.421
Understood.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16386-0
02:14:15.981 --> 02:14:18.541
Sorry, sorry, extremely. It's OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16391-0
02:14:21.821 --> 02:14:25.861
I thought it's working anyway.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16397-0
02:14:29.381 --> 02:14:33.381
If you want,
you can switch off the switch.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16400-0
02:14:34.901 --> 02:14:36.101
Oh yes, I'm sharing the screen.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16409-0
02:14:37.901 --> 02:14:41.786
So guys,
is this screen uh visible to all of you

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16409-1
02:14:41.786 --> 02:14:42.341
online?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16445-0
02:14:44.381 --> 02:14:48.190
So operators in Python,
we have seen the arithmetic,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16445-1
02:14:48.190 --> 02:14:52.933
we have seen the plus, we have seen minus,
we have seen asterisk,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16416-0
02:14:48.301 --> 02:14:48.821
Yeah.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16445-2
02:14:52.933 --> 02:14:57.675
we have seen the division,
we have seen the modulus that give you

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16445-3
02:14:57.675 --> 02:15:00.621
the reminder. The next one is assignment.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16446-0
02:15:00.701 --> 02:15:00.941
And.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16448-0
02:15:02.061 --> 02:15:03.821
So you have right here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16455-0
02:15:05.141 --> 02:15:07.981
You have right here. For example,
you have right this one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16503-0
02:15:10.101 --> 02:15:14.690
Username equal to input.
This is known as assignment operator.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16503-1
02:15:14.690 --> 02:15:18.841
It's not equal to.
To check the equality we use equal to

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16503-2
02:15:18.841 --> 02:15:22.337
equal to.
We have write twice equal to equal to

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16503-3
02:15:22.337 --> 02:15:27.944
that come under the logical operator.
So assignment means it's assigning the

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16503-4
02:15:27.944 --> 02:15:28.381
value.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16543-0
02:15:28.741 --> 02:15:32.201
For example,
you are right username equal to your

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16543-1
02:15:32.201 --> 02:15:36.006
right 71256.
That means you have assigned the username

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16543-2
02:15:36.006 --> 02:15:39.188
71256.
You have right number one and you have

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16543-3
02:15:39.188 --> 02:15:44.861
given the value 25 so that is assignment
operator. The next one is plus equal to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16552-0
02:15:45.301 --> 02:15:48.867
You have write the value plus this one
and minus equal to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16552-1
02:15:48.867 --> 02:15:50.861
For example let me show you here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16573-0
02:15:55.821 --> 02:16:03.884
Let me create one more file here.
Right click here new file and I have

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16573-1
02:16:03.884 --> 02:16:09.221
given the name to this one is operator
dot PY.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16576-0
02:16:10.301 --> 02:16:13.381
Fine, you can give any name.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16577-0
02:16:14.381 --> 02:16:14.421
Uh.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16596-0
02:16:18.621 --> 02:16:24.215
Operators dot PY. You can give any name,
whatever the name you want to give.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16596-1
02:16:24.215 --> 02:16:27.701
I've given operators dot PY.
Here we are right.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16600-0
02:16:29.501 --> 02:16:32.221
Num one is equal to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16605-0
02:16:34.181 --> 02:16:38.421
20 Well, let me write number one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16609-0
02:16:40.301 --> 02:16:43.741

02:17:05.020 --> 02:17:10.016
we have assigned to this one.
Let me give the name to this one is price.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16658-2
02:17:10.016 --> 02:17:14.602
We have assigned to the price.
So the user have entered the price,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16658-3
02:17:14.602 --> 02:17:16.381

OK, what is 10? Where 10 is new line?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16732-0
02:19:31.101 --> 02:19:34.301
It is for new line, let's say new line.

I have right here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16751-0
02:20:14.861 --> 02:20:15.221
Right then.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16753-0
02:20:17.421 --> 02:20:18.861
Operators.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16761-0
02:20:20.461 --> 02:20:26.541
dot PY under amount price for example
this is 2000.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16769-0
02:20:30.101 --> 02:20:33.981
Discounted 200, discounted price is 1800.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16795-0
02:20:45.381 --> 02:20:52.390
Do we double s? Oh, let me change. Sorry,
it will be a double N, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16795-1
02:20:52.390 --> 02:20:59.496
It will be the double slash right N,
right? No, no single this this one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16795-2
02:20:59.496 --> 02:21:02.221
See here we are right price.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16818-0
02:21:02.581 --> 02:21:06.124
Price will go here,
then next line we won't discount,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16818-1
02:21:06.124 --> 02:21:09.797
so we are right. Excellent.
N means go to the new line,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16818-2
02:21:09.797 --> 02:21:14.061
then we are right next line,
go to the new line. You got it? OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16821-0
02:21:15.301 --> 02:21:17.461
And now to this world.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16825-0
02:21:18.701 --> 02:21:20.541
Space is not required.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16862-0
02:21:21.861 --> 02:21:25.025
Because in first line we want to display
the price.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16862-1
02:21:25.025 --> 02:21:29.588
In the second line we want to display.
Let's say this is 5000 for example.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16862-2
02:21:29.588 --> 02:21:33.604
So first line is the price,
second line is discount and the third

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16862-3
02:21:33.604 --> 02:21:36.341
line is this third line is discounted
price.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16865-0
02:22:08.461 --> 02:22:08.581
Yes.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16867-0
02:22:19.501 --> 02:22:20.781
Go ahead.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16893-0
02:22:45.301 --> 02:22:51.304
Done. So this is equal to.
You understand that is assigning the

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16893-1
02:22:51.304 --> 02:22:55.430
value.
Now let's go plus equal to and minus

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16893-2
02:22:55.430 --> 02:22:59.181
equal to right in done up to this level.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16900-0
02:23:03.061 --> 02:23:06.941
I have comment to this one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16910-0
02:23:12.701 --> 02:23:19.901
You can't print. Yeah, I see the switch.
No.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16911-0
02:23:23.621 --> 02:23:24.421
Yeah.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16912-0
02:23:26.421 --> 02:23:26.941
But.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16914-0
02:23:34.261 --> 02:23:36.261
You need someone about that.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16915-0
02:23:37.501 --> 02:23:37.581

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16929-0
02:23:44.541 --> 02:23:56.981
Yeah, that's right. That's right.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16941-0
02:23:57.901 --> 02:24:12.621

02:24:12.981 --> 02:24:24.516
But you don't like take a little bit of
the query to commit this.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16942-1
02:24:24.516 --> 02:24:27.661
I'll read this so.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16967-0
02:24:34.541 --> 02:24:38.930
Now the other two operators plus equal to
minus equal to equal to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16967-1
02:24:38.930 --> 02:24:42.992
I already shown you,
so let's see the plus equal to and minus

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16967-2
02:24:42.992 --> 02:24:43.581

02:24:46.821 --> 02:24:49.333
So we are discussing the assignment
operator,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16983-1
02:24:49.333 --> 02:24:53.101
the arithmetic I have showed you earlier.
This is assignment, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/16997-0
02:24:54.821 --> 02:25:01.577

That would be fine.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/17019-0

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/17030-1
02:25:31.159 --> 02:25:32.541

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/17037-0
02:25:36.541 --> 02:25:40.061

02:43:21.861 --> 02:43:24.541
Salary after tax.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18085-0
02:43:30.741 --> 02:43:30.861
So.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18118-0
02:43:33.021 --> 02:43:37.160
Second,
this line #16 I want to change that it

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18118-1
02:43:37.160 --> 02:43:42.354
will deduct the TDs and display the
salary after this one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18118-2
02:43:42.354 --> 02:43:47.901
So what I should write here on line #17?
This is the question.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18127-0
02:43:49.301 --> 02:43:58.741
Just just minus equal to minus equal to
what?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18166-0
02:44:00.501 --> 02:44:04.809
Absolutely correct.
So this is minus equal to TDs.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18166-1
02:44:04.809 --> 02:44:11.566
What this means? It means this one. OK,
so the minus equal to will do the same.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18166-2
02:44:11.566 --> 02:44:16.465
It will minus from that one. Got it.
So that's the thing.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18166-3
02:44:16.465 --> 02:44:20.181
This is one more example we have done
here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18167-0
02:44:20.261 --> 02:44:20.861
And see.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18197-0
02:44:21.981 --> 02:44:26.885
This one I have not done.
Second I have done for you this example,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18197-1
02:44:26.885 --> 02:44:32.374
right? You have done it for them, right?
Now she's teaching to you, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18197-2
02:44:32.374 --> 02:44:38.301
So now here salary is this much and the
TDs is this much after tax. This is the.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18199-0
02:44:38.421 --> 02:44:40.221
Thank got it.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18235-0
02:44:43.461 --> 02:44:47.884
This is assignment.
These are under the these operators we

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18235-1
02:44:47.884 --> 02:44:52.756
are discussing right now.
So the assignment is equal to and plus

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18235-2
02:44:52.756 --> 02:44:57.703
equal to minus equal to.
So the third one we also have done equal

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18235-3
02:44:57.703 --> 02:45:00.701
to means just equal assigning the value.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18268-0
02:45:03.061 --> 02:45:10.261
The this textbook also I have shared with
you this PPT also I have shared with you

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18268-1
02:45:10.261 --> 02:45:16.506
right open with Adobe reader.
So this one we just this is kind of stuff

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18268-2
02:45:16.506 --> 02:45:18.501
we are discussing here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18270-0
02:45:19.301 --> 02:45:20.861
Uh, where will be?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18325-0
02:45:22.581 --> 02:45:28.171
So few things I will take you later on.
Right now I am going to teach you this

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18325-1
02:45:28.171 --> 02:45:33.478
thing. So we we have done the number two.
This is assignment operator. OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18325-2
02:45:33.478 --> 02:45:38.502
After this we will go to the number three
that is comparison operator.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18325-3
02:45:38.502 --> 02:45:42.181
If you want to compare two things that is
known as.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18334-0
02:45:42.581 --> 02:45:46.001
Comparison operator.
So up to two we have done any doubt

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18334-1
02:45:46.001 --> 02:45:47.981
question if you have you can ask.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18336-0
02:45:51.541 --> 02:45:52.221
Got it.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18371-0
02:46:02.421 --> 02:46:07.327
This is the day number one.
After this I will start asking you the

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18371-1
02:46:07.327 --> 02:46:11.061
questions as well.
Vince exercises as well, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18371-2
02:46:11.061 --> 02:46:16.771
But I don't get there is a one day.
We just now this this -1 you have not get

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18371-3
02:46:16.771 --> 02:46:18.821
it. This will be at upon us.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18398-0
02:46:19.461 --> 02:46:23.515
Because because what? OK,
you already did one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18398-1
02:46:23.515 --> 02:46:30.500
So I just want to know that you put like
a salary plus equals bonus and then you

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18398-2
02:46:30.500 --> 02:46:35.501
put hashtag salary, salary plus bonus.
What? What is the?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18432-0
02:46:35.701 --> 02:46:38.970
This one,
this one is just to explain you means

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18432-1
02:46:38.970 --> 02:46:44.349
salary means salary plus equal to bonus
means we are going to add the bonus in

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18432-2
02:46:44.349 --> 02:46:49.796
the salary and assigning to the salary
bag. So I have to put in the budget too.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18432-3
02:46:49.796 --> 02:46:51.021
Is that necessary?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18474-0
02:46:51.141 --> 02:46:54.871
This one, this line. Yes. No, no,
it's not necessary.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18474-1
02:46:54.871 --> 02:46:59.774
This one is just to make you understand
what the meaning of this line.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18474-2
02:46:59.774 --> 02:47:05.299
I you have to write only this much I OK
and here also this one is not necessary

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18474-3
02:47:05.299 --> 02:47:09.581
because I'm teaching you just to make you
understand just to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18515-0
02:47:09.701 --> 02:47:13.299
Remind you later on the meaning of this
line is this.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18515-1
02:47:13.299 --> 02:47:17.496
The meaning of this line was that OK that
I have just removed.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18515-2
02:47:17.496 --> 02:47:22.426
I I think so it's help when you have
programming or all these comments or

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18515-3
02:47:22.426 --> 02:47:27.556
people coming later they understand why.
Yes absolutely comment means we are

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18515-4
02:47:27.556 --> 02:47:29.221
writing the comment just.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18536-0
02:47:29.381 --> 02:47:32.509
To make our code the explain our code
fine.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18536-1
02:47:32.509 --> 02:47:38.266
So if someone else read out your code,
he can understand what that means and let

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18536-2
02:47:38.266 --> 02:47:39.261
me write here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18538-0
02:47:41.221 --> 02:47:42.421
Meaning of the slide.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18553-0
02:47:57.701 --> 02:48:02.837
Right. That's it. I mean,
so I'll give this balance.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18553-1
02:48:02.837 --> 02:48:07.101
That means this, right?
But it is tough to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18559-0
02:48:11.981 --> 02:48:14.621
Digest this one is simple,
so it's up to you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18561-0
02:48:17.181 --> 02:48:17.501
Done.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18598-0
02:48:19.221 --> 02:48:22.965
So we now let's move to the comparison
operator.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18598-1
02:48:22.965 --> 02:48:27.931
You want to do this comparison between
two things for something.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18598-2
02:48:27.931 --> 02:48:32.362
So the comparison operator will return
you true or false.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18598-3
02:48:32.362 --> 02:48:36.181
If you'll compare two things,
it will return you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18626-0
02:48:36.181 --> 02:48:42.393
True or false? To do that,
we need to understand the if as well if

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18626-1
02:48:42.393 --> 02:48:48.697
else, right? So let's start.
So I'm going to discuss the comparison

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18626-2
02:48:48.697 --> 02:48:51.941
operator plus the if else with you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18629-0
02:48:52.621 --> 02:48:54.781
The next hit song.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18631-0
02:48:56.341 --> 02:48:57.421
Should I write here?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18633-0
02:48:59.341 --> 02:49:00.741
Done up to this level.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18642-0
02:49:02.821 --> 02:49:08.955
Fine. Should we start the comparison?
No is the comparison operators.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18642-1
02:49:08.955 --> 02:49:10.181
I'll paste it.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18645-0
02:49:20.741 --> 02:49:22.741
Is comparison operate?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18672-0
02:49:25.341 --> 02:49:28.068
Fine,
we are going to discuss now the

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18672-1
02:49:28.068 --> 02:49:31.944
comparison operator.
See here before I will start the

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18672-2
02:49:31.944 --> 02:49:36.393
comparison operator,
I will show you here we write if here we

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18672-3
02:49:36.393 --> 02:49:37.541
write condition.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18681-0
02:49:42.621 --> 02:49:47.061
If the condition is true,
this part will execute.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18690-0
02:49:51.501 --> 02:49:55.725
Code will later the code.
This code will execute if the condition

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18690-1
02:49:55.725 --> 02:49:56.301
is false.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18692-0
02:50:02.501 --> 02:50:03.061
Else.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18700-0
02:50:04.701 --> 02:50:09.701
I'll write here the code that will
execute and let me write here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18719-0
02:50:11.261 --> 02:50:14.421
Control case. So this is.
If the condition is true,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18719-1
02:50:14.421 --> 02:50:17.519
this part will execute.
If the condition is false,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18719-2
02:50:17.519 --> 02:50:19.341
this part will execute, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18728-0
02:50:22.301 --> 02:50:27.621
So for example here I'm writing over here,
let's say.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18730-0
02:50:29.461 --> 02:50:29.581
Page.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18733-0
02:50:32.621 --> 02:50:35.061
I have right here input.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18750-0
02:50:37.661 --> 02:50:43.450
Enter your age.
We are taking the age of the person who

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18750-1
02:50:43.450 --> 02:50:49.341
is using this program, right?
And we have right here if.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18751-0
02:50:50.741 --> 02:50:50.821
Age.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18768-0
02:50:53.061 --> 02:50:56.541
Greater than equal to.
This is the comparison operator.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18768-1
02:50:56.541 --> 02:51:00.021
Which one we are using?
This one greater than equal to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18791-0
02:51:01.661 --> 02:51:06.573
Fine or greater.
Let's see we have used greater than equal

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18791-1
02:51:06.573 --> 02:51:09.986
to.
If the age is equal to or greater 18

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18791-2
02:51:09.986 --> 02:51:14.981
years, 18 I have right.
If this is the case, we have print.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18793-0
02:51:18.981 --> 02:51:19.261
Print.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18795-0
02:51:21.701 --> 02:51:23.781
You are.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18800-0
02:51:26.821 --> 02:51:32.141
Eligible to cast your vote.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18809-0
02:52:05.181 --> 02:52:07.021
We have right here and.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18843-0
02:52:24.221 --> 02:52:28.291
See here indentation is also important.
Indent is also important.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18843-1
02:52:28.291 --> 02:52:32.978
You're right if then you have to write
one tab and then you can write this.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18843-2
02:52:32.978 --> 02:52:36.061
This is call it if this is the condition
is true.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18863-0
02:52:37.101 --> 02:52:40.393
If the condition is true,
then this part will execute.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18863-1
02:52:40.393 --> 02:52:43.744
If the condition is false,
then else part will execute.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18863-2
02:52:43.744 --> 02:52:44.821
We have rate here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18892-0
02:52:46.221 --> 02:52:50.665
Else let me show you without IELTS.
First of all this one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18892-1
02:52:50.665 --> 02:52:56.540
If it is this condition is met then it
will show you you are eligible to cast

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18892-2
02:52:56.540 --> 02:53:00.381
your vote otherwise and nothing right?
So here is.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18898-0
02:53:02.501 --> 02:53:05.501
We'll go here view terminal.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18910-0
02:53:08.141 --> 02:53:13.421
Here I have right.
Let me clear the screen first of all CLS.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18944-0
02:53:14.621 --> 02:53:20.776
Here is Python operators dot P enter age.
I have entered the age 21 so you are

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18944-1
02:53:20.776 --> 02:53:26.229
eligible to cast your vote.
If your age is 18 years or more than that

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18944-2
02:53:26.229 --> 02:53:29.501
then you can participate to cast the vote.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18969-0
02:53:29.981 --> 02:53:34.533
Say if I have right CLS,
I have run it again and I have right here

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18969-1
02:53:34.533 --> 02:53:38.949
12. So here is nothing.
If you want the in the nothing case also

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18969-2
02:53:38.949 --> 02:53:42.141
you want something so you can write here
else.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18978-0
02:53:46.301 --> 02:53:50.541
Here's the colon you can write here.
After all you write print.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18983-0
02:53:51.701 --> 02:53:53.501
You are not eligible.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18985-0
02:53:58.581 --> 02:53:59.821
Eligible.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18987-0
02:54:01.101 --> 02:54:01.941
To cost.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/18992-0
02:54:07.141 --> 02:54:08.941
Your vote. You have to wait.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19038-0
02:54:18.541 --> 02:54:22.216
Let me explain one more time this thing.
What is it?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19038-1
02:54:22.216 --> 02:54:25.612
We are going to take the age of the user,
right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19038-2
02:54:25.612 --> 02:54:29.702
And here is the comparison operator
greater than equal to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19038-3
02:54:29.702 --> 02:54:34.208
If the age is greater than equal to 18,
it will return you true.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19038-4
02:54:34.208 --> 02:54:35.941
What it will return true?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19068-0
02:54:36.301 --> 02:54:41.272
So if it is true then it will display you
are eligible to cast your vote.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19068-1
02:54:41.272 --> 02:54:46.377
If it is false then it will display you
are not eligible to cast your vote.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19068-2
02:54:46.377 --> 02:54:50.541
You have to wait fine and at the end we
have read this print.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19070-0
02:54:53.021 --> 02:54:54.541
End of program.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19071-0
02:54:57.301 --> 02:54:57.581
And off.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19073-0
02:54:58.821 --> 02:54:59.101
Program.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19092-0
02:55:02.341 --> 02:55:05.709
Oh, just this one.
So if this condition is true,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19092-1
02:55:05.709 --> 02:55:09.627
then this part will execute.
If this condition is false,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19092-2
02:55:09.627 --> 02:55:12.101
then this part will execute. Got it?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19094-0
02:55:13.461 --> 02:55:14.781
Yes or no?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19109-0
02:55:16.981 --> 02:55:25.661
Yes, but but it's too much, huh? No, see,
I will. I will show you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19108-0
02:55:24.701 --> 02:55:25.461
Sir, I have a question.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19111-0
02:55:26.741 --> 02:55:27.901
Yeah, sure, you can ask.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19119-0
02:55:28.621 --> 02:55:30.581
Uh, about the intent?
How to in the intent?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19150-0
02:55:33.061 --> 02:55:37.731
OK, good. See here.
Here is one question he is asking how you

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19150-1
02:55:37.731 --> 02:55:42.777
have done this indent thing.
Let me write it again for all of you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19150-2
02:55:42.777 --> 02:55:46.618
It's fine.
I'm writing again the same code just to

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19150-3
02:55:46.618 --> 02:55:49.781
show you the things. Should I write again?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19180-0
02:55:51.381 --> 02:55:55.503
OK,
I have commented this one and I'm writing

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19180-1
02:55:55.503 --> 02:56:01.685
it for you again just to show you.
I'm writing here age is equal to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19180-2
02:56:01.685 --> 02:56:07.061
We have right here int we want to take
from the user input.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19183-0
02:56:07.541 --> 02:56:09.341

02:56:11.221 --> 02:56:15.102
Your age.
So whatever the age user have entered,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19219-1
02:56:15.102 --> 02:56:20.488
we have assigned to this age.
We have right here if age here we are

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19219-2
02:56:20.488 --> 02:56:27.141
right greater than equal to 18 and we are
right this colon and then you just enter.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19244-0
02:56:28.501 --> 02:56:33.352
From here you press the enter.
You need not to worried about the

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19244-1
02:56:33.352 --> 02:56:36.710
indentation.
You write here enter so it will

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19244-2
02:56:36.710 --> 02:56:41.412
automatically put it to here right?
You have right here print.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19244-3
02:56:41.412 --> 02:56:43.501
You have right here you are.

You are eligible.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19271-0
02:56:48.221 --> 02:56:56.752
To cost your vote fine and then you will
go here this line the if and else in will

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19271-1

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19278-0
02:57:17.861 --> 02:57:20.701
You are not eligible.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19285-0
02:57:22.221 --> 02:57:24.941
Fine. And then you will write here print.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19287-0

02:57:34.341 --> 02:57:36.981
Program. Is it clear now?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19301-0
02:57:38.621 --> 02:57:43.221
Yes, who is asking indentation?
Is it fine?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19323-0
02:57:41.781 --> 02:57:46.556
No, yes,
but you see like right after the evening

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19323-1
02:57:46.556 --> 02:57:53.621
else there's a space there. What?
What do I press that to get that space?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19312-0
02:57:49.701 --> 02:57:50.181
Mhm.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19369-0
02:57:52.701 --> 02:57:56.818
So you you can press the tab.
If you are going to the that line you can

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19328-0
02:57:55.221 --> 02:57:56.181
Tab OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19369-1
02:57:56.818 --> 02:58:01.335
press the tab that is space will come out
or if you are writing from colon you

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19333-0
02:57:57.861 --> 02:57:57.901
Oh.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19369-2

02:58:04.251 --> 02:58:07.739
Otherwise if you are in the same line you
can press one tab.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19351-0
02:58:04.421 --> 02:58:04.461
Oh.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19369-4
02:58:07.739 --> 02:58:12.541
For example you have rated this way right?
So you press one tab so it will be here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19400-0
02:58:12.621 --> 02:58:16.419
Got it. There's no significant watch,
so I worry the problem.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19400-1
02:58:16.419 --> 02:58:19.297
I mean just to make it clear. Yes,
absolutely.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19382-0
02:58:19.141 --> 02:58:19.781
Thank you, Sir.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19400-2
02:58:19.297 --> 02:58:23.400
If you are writing in the same line,
it will give you that, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19400-3
02:58:23.400 --> 02:58:25.421
You press the tab, it will be OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19399-0
02:58:25.381 --> 02:58:25.941
Thank you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19402-0
02:58:27.261 --> 02:58:28.301
Welcome.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19403-0

Weather.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19439-0
02:58:32.781 --> 02:58:36.750
Fine.
Now this is 1 logical operator you have

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19439-1
02:58:36.750 --> 02:58:40.891
used here.
The logical operator is greater than

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19439-2
02:58:40.891 --> 02:58:45.204
equal to.
If this number is greater than equal to

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19439-3
02:58:45.204 --> 02:58:48.741
18 then it will be true and if it is not.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19448-0
02:58:49.981 --> 02:58:54.541
Then it will be false and it will show
you this stuff. Here we go view terminal.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19451-0
02:59:07.461 --> 02:59:07.901
And.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19479-0
02:59:10.661 --> 02:59:15.451
You have run it again age.
I have rate here 34 so you are eligible

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19479-1
02:59:15.451 --> 02:59:19.597
to pass the vote.
For example this time I have rate 12 so

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19479-2
02:59:19.597 --> 02:59:22.742
this you are not eligible to pass the
vote.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19479-3
02:59:22.742 --> 02:59:26.101
I have showed you both the things right
right.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19480-0
02:59:26.741 --> 02:59:26.901
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19509-0
03:02:47.301 --> 03:02:48.101
So done.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19511-0
03:02:51.661 --> 03:02:53.501
The most.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19531-0
03:04:19.141 --> 03:04:21.021
Done. I love you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19533-0
03:04:24.261 --> 03:04:25.141
Please complete.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19540-0
03:04:28.781 --> 03:04:31.461
Was he? What about you done?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19558-0
03:04:37.421 --> 03:04:40.943
If it is too cold,
you can just increase that this

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19558-1
03:04:40.943 --> 03:04:44.604
temperature.
Finally you can take the remote and you

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19558-2
03:04:44.604 --> 03:04:45.501
can increase.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19578-0
03:04:47.661 --> 03:04:54.776
Excuse I have been that's that's so cold.
It's yours because the outside it's

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19578-1
03:04:54.776 --> 03:04:57.421
raining might be due to that.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19583-0
03:05:04.381 --> 03:05:09.501
Your sisters. Your sisters. No, no.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19584-0
03:05:11.061 --> 03:05:11.221
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19592-0
03:05:13.941 --> 03:05:19.861
You are ordering like that only like the
elder sister do.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19597-0
03:05:21.101 --> 03:05:24.141
That's good. OK, that's fine.
Just kidding, huh?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19599-0
03:05:34.141 --> 03:05:35.261
Anyway, uh.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19617-0
03:05:51.381 --> 03:05:57.666
So this is greater than equal to.
Similarly we can use the less than equal

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19617-1
03:05:57.666 --> 03:05:59.341
to so if it is less.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19619-0
03:06:01.981 --> 03:06:03.021
For example.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19622-0
03:06:09.221 --> 03:06:09.981
You are right here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19624-0
03:06:12.141 --> 03:06:13.541
Let's see. Uh.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19627-0
03:06:16.301 --> 03:06:18.461
Marks percentage or something?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19629-0
03:06:19.621 --> 03:06:19.781
Mugs.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19631-0
03:06:21.941 --> 03:06:23.061
Here it is.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19632-0
03:06:26.181 --> 03:06:26.301
And.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19635-0
03:06:27.781 --> 03:06:28.181
Input.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19644-0
03:06:40.181 --> 03:06:45.661
Let me just do different. OK,
input here is.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19647-0
03:06:46.701 --> 03:06:49.141
Enter marks.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19649-0
03:06:52.261 --> 03:06:53.221
Percentage.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19651-0
03:06:55.461 --> 03:06:55.661
Without.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19655-0
03:06:58.101 --> 03:06:59.141
Percent sign.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19659-0
03:07:08.541 --> 03:07:10.661
So if you want to show this one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19681-0
03:07:12.341 --> 03:07:17.628
Without percent sign.
So if you want something that have the

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19681-1
03:07:17.628 --> 03:07:21.875
meaning,
you have to write in single quotes that

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19681-2
03:07:21.875 --> 03:07:23.261
one. So here is.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19682-0
03:07:24.501 --> 03:07:24.541
Uh.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19691-0
03:07:26.981 --> 03:07:31.141
Here is what we will do if you go out
marks.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19693-0
03:07:36.301 --> 03:07:37.221
Less than.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19695-0
03:07:39.941 --> 03:07:39.981
30%.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19698-0
03:07:44.781 --> 03:07:46.421
We are right here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19699-0
03:07:50.101 --> 03:07:50.381
Print.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19701-0
03:07:56.381 --> 03:07:58.261
It will take some.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19702-0
03:08:09.901 --> 03:08:10.141
And.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19703-0
03:08:13.701 --> 03:08:13.861
And.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19705-0
03:08:19.141 --> 03:08:19.301
So.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19707-0
03:08:21.301 --> 03:08:22.741
It is less.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19712-0
03:08:38.101 --> 03:08:39.061
What's your name?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19726-0
03:08:40.701 --> 03:08:54.191
Yes, yes. Shami. Shami. Shami. Yeah,
Shamir. Shamir. OK, how to spell S what?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19726-1
03:08:54.191 --> 03:08:58.341
EWN by N Shamir. Shamir.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19728-0
03:09:00.821 --> 03:09:01.061
So uh.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19734-0
03:09:03.101 --> 03:09:04.341
You have write this code OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19744-0
03:09:06.621 --> 03:09:13.421
Here is if I enter 3030 exact 30,
what will be output?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19752-0
03:09:17.621 --> 03:09:22.061
If someone get the 30,
what will be output? He is pass or fail?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19765-0
03:09:26.741 --> 03:09:31.821
30 I'm not asking 31, I'm not asking 29.
I'm asking about 30.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19771-0
03:09:33.581 --> 03:09:38.261
30 What will be the result? Fail or pass?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19774-0
03:09:40.701 --> 03:09:42.981
Clear pass.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19781-0
03:09:45.381 --> 03:09:47.701
What do you say? What's your name?
What do you say?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19783-0
03:09:49.381 --> 03:09:52.021
Huh. That's fine. Plus. Plus.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19784-0
03:09:52.101 --> 03:09:52.301
6.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19790-0
03:09:55.701 --> 03:09:57.341
OK, we'll go here view.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19792-0
03:09:58.941 --> 03:09:59.821
Terminal.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19815-0
03:10:03.581 --> 03:10:11.001
View terminal you will write here CLS
here is Python operators.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19815-1
03:10:11.001 --> 03:10:18.421
We have entered 30 so clear the exam
because we have seen less.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19840-0
03:10:18.981 --> 03:10:27.528
Less than 30. If less than 30, he is fail.
If you are at 29 here, so he is fail.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19840-1
03:10:27.528 --> 03:10:32.381
If you're at 30, more than 30,
that is false.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19846-0
03:10:33.741 --> 03:10:39.301
Why? Why you didn't see password here?
I have read clear and uh.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19881-0
03:10:40.421 --> 03:10:45.281
Clear the exam and no,
I have not run the program.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19881-1
03:10:45.281 --> 03:10:53.380
That's why it's OK. So here's the Python.
You have rate 30 and we have rate here 35.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19881-2
03:10:53.380 --> 03:10:57.381
Clear the and see that's it was like this.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19910-0
03:10:57.741 --> 03:11:02.159
Fine.
So we have to run it inside the program.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19910-1
03:11:02.159 --> 03:11:08.926
Here is the we have rate the 30.
Cleared the exam. I have run it again.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19910-2
03:11:08.926 --> 03:11:13.061
I have rate for 22 fail.
I have rate again.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19937-0
03:11:13.661 --> 03:11:19.252
I have right here 45.
So in case of this one if you are not

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19937-1
03:11:19.252 --> 03:11:25.680
right plus equal to so it will just check
less than or greater than.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19937-2
03:11:25.680 --> 03:11:28.941
If you write equal to also it will.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19939-0
03:11:29.021 --> 03:11:31.461
Fail on 30 as well, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19940-0
03:11:32.661 --> 03:11:33.141
Clip.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19965-0
03:11:35.821 --> 03:11:41.798
So less than greater than greater than
means greater than this one greater than

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19965-1
03:11:41.798 --> 03:11:45.459
equal to.
These are known as comparison operator

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19965-2
03:11:45.459 --> 03:11:48.821
not equal to.
Here is one more not equal to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19971-0
03:11:49.981 --> 03:11:54.661
Fine, let me show you not equal to.
So first we'll do this one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19975-0
03:12:18.021 --> 03:12:18.341
Then.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19982-0
03:12:20.741 --> 03:12:26.221
OK, not equal to.
Should I show you not equal to?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19984-0
03:12:27.181 --> 03:12:29.021
Uh, here it is.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19990-0
03:12:30.181 --> 03:12:32.501
Then up to this level, yes or no?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/19996-0
03:12:33.821 --> 03:12:37.701
Done this this program online one all of
you done.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20002-0
03:12:42.581 --> 03:12:46.061
With those head up. OK, thank you.
So now uh.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20007-0
03:12:48.941 --> 03:12:52.141
Let's see here is not equal to one
example.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20018-0
03:12:54.661 --> 03:12:59.861
Here we have entered here we have declare
1 access code.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20022-0
03:13:01.781 --> 03:13:04.741
Access code is equal to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20024-0
03:13:06.341 --> 03:13:07.741
I have rate.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20029-0
03:13:12.581 --> 03:13:18.821
WES ES12.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20043-0
03:13:20.501 --> 03:13:26.581
So this is the access code WES12 fine.
Here we are right.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20062-0
03:13:51.501 --> 03:13:57.390
For example, this is the access code 1-2,
right? So we want to do that.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20062-1
03:13:57.390 --> 03:14:00.661
We want to check here. I'm writing here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20064-0
03:14:02.501 --> 03:14:03.421
Texas code.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20067-0
03:14:10.101 --> 03:14:11.301
Input.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20070-0
03:14:14.021 --> 03:14:16.381
Enter access code.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20084-0
03:14:18.341 --> 03:14:23.544
Whatever user have entered,
we have assigned to this one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20084-1
03:14:23.544 --> 03:14:27.221
We are right if access code not equal to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20087-0
03:14:28.901 --> 03:14:31.061
WES 12.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20091-0
03:14:32.741 --> 03:14:34.621
If it is not this one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20094-0
03:14:35.501 --> 03:14:37.701
We have right here print.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20096-0
03:14:44.661 --> 03:14:46.341
Wrong password.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20098-0
03:14:52.501 --> 03:14:53.621
Or invalid.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20099-0
03:14:53.861 --> 03:14:54.021
Is.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20100-0
03:14:56.341 --> 03:14:56.821
Access.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20101-0
03:14:58.501 --> 03:14:58.541
Oh.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20103-0
03:15:13.221 --> 03:15:13.461
Else.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20109-0
03:15:20.261 --> 03:15:23.821
Welcome to your course.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20139-0
03:15:37.261 --> 03:15:42.407
Fine. So we have an access code.
We are asking to the user the access code.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20139-1
03:15:42.407 --> 03:15:47.282
If the access code not equal to the given
one, whatever you have given.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20139-2
03:15:47.282 --> 03:15:51.141
So we have rate no not allowed otherwise
allowed, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20140-0
03:15:54.421 --> 03:15:54.821
Yeah.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20162-0
03:16:28.821 --> 03:16:33.761
So this one is also the comment, right?
If you don't want to write it,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20162-1
03:16:33.761 --> 03:16:35.221
it's also fine. Fine.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20190-0
03:16:36.701 --> 03:16:40.891
Enter the access code.
The access code is not equal to VS12,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20190-1
03:16:40.891 --> 03:16:44.874
so invalid access code.
Otherwise welcome to your course.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20190-2
03:16:44.874 --> 03:16:47.621
So we have an access code that is VES12.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20195-0
03:16:48.781 --> 03:16:51.661
If it is not, did not equal to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20202-0
03:17:36.821 --> 03:17:37.821
Thank you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20205-0
03:17:41.021 --> 03:17:42.581
I'm not writing the force.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20210-0
03:17:43.701 --> 03:17:47.621
Hello, what's your name? Shabina. Shabina,
you're not writing the code.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20211-0
03:17:51.381 --> 03:17:51.781
Good.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20246-0
03:18:12.261 --> 03:18:16.512
OK, you will learn it.
After this I will ask you one question,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20246-1
03:18:16.512 --> 03:18:19.819
right?
One simple exercise that you guys have to

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20246-2
03:18:19.819 --> 03:18:24.947
do fine to check whether you have
understand what we have done up to now or

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20246-3
03:18:24.947 --> 03:18:26.701
not. View terminal, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20252-0
03:18:28.261 --> 03:18:31.501
He's smiling.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20277-0
03:18:33.261 --> 03:18:40.233
Access code I have right here something
something. So here is invalid access code.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20277-1
03:18:40.233 --> 03:18:45.021
I have run it again.
This time I write the same BES 1/2.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20280-0
03:18:46.461 --> 03:18:47.981
Welcome to our calls.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20283-0
03:18:48.941 --> 03:18:50.381
Welcome to your course.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20288-0
03:18:53.141 --> 03:18:55.501
Right, if you want some sort of.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20295-0
03:18:56.861 --> 03:18:59.621
The space in between so you can write
this way also.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20300-0
03:19:00.941 --> 03:19:03.381
So here is view terminal.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20305-0
03:19:07.421 --> 03:19:11.861
Access code VES 1-2.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20319-0
03:19:18.061 --> 03:19:21.243
Right.
If not equal to this one something else

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20319-1
03:19:21.243 --> 03:19:25.101
you have right then it will say you
invalid access code.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20331-0
03:19:27.901 --> 03:19:34.141
Can check that one as well.
Here is I have read something VER 2/1.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20345-0
03:19:40.421 --> 03:19:41.821
Sorry.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20352-0
03:19:45.421 --> 03:19:48.941
You have it exact same not equal to we
have use.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20361-0
03:19:55.781 --> 03:20:01.661
What do we want to? It's not it's not.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20362-0
03:20:03.141 --> 03:20:03.301
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20365-0
03:20:07.461 --> 03:20:13.061
Oh, oh.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20375-0
03:20:25.501 --> 03:20:31.161
No, it's basically.
It should be exact same without any space

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20375-1
03:20:31.161 --> 03:20:32.621
if you read the.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20378-0
03:20:34.181 --> 03:20:36.781
Not equally.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20412-0
03:20:41.581 --> 03:20:45.852
I know that's an issue,
so that it will be equal to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20412-1
03:20:45.852 --> 03:20:51.815
We will do it assignment, right? No, no,
you have to use double equal to,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20412-2
03:20:51.815 --> 03:20:56.327
double equal to.
See here you're saying if you want the

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20412-3
03:20:56.327 --> 03:20:58.261
access port is equal to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20437-0
03:21:00.701 --> 03:21:06.842
You want to write the reverse.
The reverse of this one is like this

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20437-1
03:21:06.842 --> 03:21:13.525
control C control KCI have commented.
I want the just reverse of this one

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20437-2
03:21:13.525 --> 03:21:15.421
control V So this is.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20447-0
03:21:16.501 --> 03:21:23.061
Equal to double equal to you have right
so invalid access code.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20449-0
03:21:26.861 --> 03:21:28.101
DW Print.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20452-0
03:21:35.621 --> 03:21:37.581
Ask for new.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20454-0
03:21:38.741 --> 03:21:39.621
Access code.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20456-0
03:21:46.981 --> 03:21:48.341
And see if.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20462-0
03:22:20.701 --> 03:22:20.821
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20468-0
03:22:23.901 --> 03:22:28.381
So this is just the reverse of this one
else.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20486-0
03:22:31.581 --> 03:22:36.813
Fine is equal to if you want to write
this one so you can write in the reverse

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20486-1
03:22:36.813 --> 03:22:37.541
order also.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20501-0
03:23:09.581 --> 03:23:15.701
So you want to this thing control X in
the reverse order you want right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20507-0
03:23:17.261 --> 03:23:19.061
You have it invalid access code here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20513-0
03:23:22.861 --> 03:23:25.861
You have right here, just the reverse, OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20527-0
03:23:35.061 --> 03:23:38.900
Don't see me, of course. Fine.
So this is in the reverse.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20527-1
03:23:38.900 --> 03:23:42.739
If you want in the reverse one,
this way you want, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20527-2
03:23:42.739 --> 03:23:44.261
You can write this way.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20550-0
03:23:48.941 --> 03:23:53.529
This is not equal to. This is equal to.
If access code is equal to,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20550-1
03:23:53.529 --> 03:23:57.645
welcome to our course,
otherwise invalid access code, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20550-2
03:23:57.645 --> 03:24:00.141
It's up to you whatever way you want.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20564-0
03:24:07.661 --> 03:24:13.128
Exclamation means not equal to,
not equal to. This is not equal to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20564-1
03:24:13.128 --> 03:24:16.021
This is equal to. Let me write here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20567-0
03:24:28.141 --> 03:24:30.741
Means not equal to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20574-0
03:24:36.941 --> 03:24:41.701
And here it is.
Let me write this one for you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20578-0
03:24:42.861 --> 03:24:44.421
Equal to equal to means.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20579-0
03:24:46.461 --> 03:24:46.741
Good.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20581-0
03:24:53.381 --> 03:24:53.541
Go.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20587-0
03:24:57.061 --> 03:24:59.341
This is comparison operators.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20600-0
03:27:17.861 --> 03:27:18.141
Thanks.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20602-0
03:27:30.781 --> 03:27:30.981
Excel.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20603-0

Thank you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20606-0
03:27:47.861 --> 03:27:49.261
That's also.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20610-0
03:28:06.381 --> 03:28:07.021
Yeah.

03:28:45.141 --> 03:28:57.861
Yes, you have raised the hand.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20625-0
03:29:00.781 --> 03:29:01.021
Hello.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20627-0
03:29:02.901 --> 03:29:03.661
Your is done.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20629-0
03:29:05.941 --> 03:29:06.821
Want to or something?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20672-0
03:29:11.781 --> 03:29:16.248
Misha, you have read that? No, I think.
I think. I think.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20672-1
03:29:16.248 --> 03:29:21.022
I think I I I accidentally. I don't know.
I didn't want that.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20672-2
03:29:21.022 --> 03:29:26.028
Just lower the hand down.
We'll click the hand again. Oh, sorry.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20672-3
03:29:26.028 --> 03:29:31.341
It was lower. Sorry. Sorry. No,
I thought someone from there anyway.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20680-0
03:29:31.461 --> 03:29:38.581
So that's why just to remember your name
is beneficial anyway.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20683-0
03:29:40.061 --> 03:29:41.581

03:32:41.701 --> 03:32:46.389
And we have taken the marks in three
subjects. One is physics,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20774-1
03:32:46.389 --> 03:32:49.141
one is chemistry, one is math, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20778-0
03:32:50.141 --> 03:32:52.821
Now we have right here if.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20781-0
03:32:53.781 --> 03:32:56.541
Marks. Mad Marks.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20792-0
03:32:57.941 --> 03:33:02.941
Greater than equal to.
Let's say we want 55 in this math.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20793-0
03:33:07.101 --> 03:33:07.941

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20800-0
03:33:10.781 --> 03:33:16.261
Physics marks greater than 12 to 50.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20801-0
03:33:18.741 --> 03:33:19.461
End.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20809-0
03:33:26.861 --> 03:33:32.461
Chemistry marks greater than equal to,
let's say.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20811-0
03:33:34.581 --> 03:33:35.341
50.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20814-0
03:33:36.861 --> 03:33:38.821
Or.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20817-0
03:33:41.861 --> 03:33:42.821
5060.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20819-0
03:34:03.021 --> 03:34:03.221
Print.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20822-0
03:34:11.261 --> 03:34:14.901
You are eligible.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20823-0
03:34:17.821 --> 03:34:17.981
2.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20824-0
03:34:19.741 --> 03:34:20.301
Sit.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20825-0
03:34:21.581 --> 03:34:22.141
In.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20828-0
03:34:37.101 --> 03:34:37.301
Hence.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20830-0
03:34:47.581 --> 03:34:48.781
You can't.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20832-0
03:34:50.341 --> 03:34:51.421
What is he played?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20836-0
03:35:17.021 --> 03:35:17.221
Right.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20882-0
03:35:19.701 --> 03:35:25.603
So this one is the criteria. For example,
you have to go to the math in greater

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20882-1
03:35:25.603 --> 03:35:29.661
than equal to 50,
physics greater than equal to 50 and

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20882-2
03:35:29.661 --> 03:35:35.710
chemistry greater than equal to 60. Fine.
In maths you must have the greater than

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20882-3
03:35:35.710 --> 03:35:38.661
equal to 55 and physics greater than 50.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20911-0
03:35:38.741 --> 03:35:46.288
And this condition is and and means all
the condition must met and means all the

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20911-1
03:35:46.288 --> 03:35:53.649
condition to to more than that whatever
is and means everything should be true

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20911-2
03:35:53.649 --> 03:35:54.021
111.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20938-0
03:35:54.101 --> 03:36:02.386
Is only one. If both is 11 then it won.
If one is 01 is 0 then it's also false.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20938-1
03:36:02.386 --> 03:36:09.221
If it is both are zero that also false.
Fine. You know that 1101.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20975-0
03:36:09.861 --> 03:36:16.046
1000 So all the condition is false,
just only the condition where everything

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20975-1
03:36:16.046 --> 03:36:21.991
is true, then it will be true.
In end case means everything must be true.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20975-2
03:36:21.991 --> 03:36:25.766
Means you must have the more than 55% in
math,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20975-3
03:36:25.766 --> 03:36:29.621
you must have more than 50 in physics you
must.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/20978-0
03:36:29.701 --> 03:36:33.661
Have more than 60 in chemistry, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21004-0
03:36:39.221 --> 03:36:44.313
I think you guys should write 50 in math
and 55 in physics, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21004-1
03:36:44.313 --> 03:36:50.469
Physics is required, not math or MVVS,
right? Search in the criteria. All right,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21004-2
03:36:50.469 --> 03:36:52.901
no, it's not the real one, just.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21014-0
03:36:53.781 --> 03:36:59.621
Suppose what these bio kids don't know
the math.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21023-0
03:37:47.381 --> 03:37:49.661
It is logical operator.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21025-0
03:38:02.341 --> 03:38:02.581
Sir.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21028-0
03:38:03.821 --> 03:38:04.301
Yes.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21029-0
03:38:04.581 --> 03:38:05.181
I have a question.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21031-0
03:38:06.501 --> 03:38:06.821
Sure.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21073-0
03:38:07.221 --> 03:38:13.360
What's the different when you put physic
marks equals to INT and then parenthesis

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21036-0
03:38:08.901 --> 03:38:09.061
Hello.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21073-1
03:38:13.360 --> 03:38:16.579
input?
But like for example for comparison

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21073-2
03:38:16.579 --> 03:38:22.417
comparison operator you just write each
and then equals to input and then the

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21073-3
03:38:22.417 --> 03:38:22.941
titles.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21081-0
03:38:24.581 --> 03:38:30.501
But this one you put physic equals to INT
and then do you get my question?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21085-0
03:38:33.461 --> 03:38:35.861
The logical operators.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21094-0
03:38:36.621 --> 03:38:40.861
Sorry, come again, come again.
I'm extremely sorry what you are asking.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21130-0
03:38:41.261 --> 03:38:45.730
OK,
in comparison operators you're writing H

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21130-1
03:38:45.730 --> 03:38:53.079
and then equals to input and then the
title inside inside but the logical

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21104-0
03:38:46.341 --> 03:38:47.341
Mm-hmm.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21108-0
03:38:49.781 --> 03:38:50.381
Mm-hmm.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21130-2
03:38:53.079 --> 03:38:58.541
operators physic mark equals to INT
parenthesis input.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21165-0
03:38:58.741 --> 03:39:07.663
See see see in that one also I have used
int. See here I have used here int.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21138-0
03:38:59.101 --> 03:39:02.861
Why not just input?
What makes the difference?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21165-1
03:39:07.663 --> 03:39:14.730
Int means integer.
We are comparing the value in the integer

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21165-2
03:39:14.730 --> 03:39:15.541
format.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21197-0
03:39:16.021 --> 03:39:20.251
We want this number right?
So we have used this int.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21197-1
03:39:20.251 --> 03:39:25.198
Int is compared to.
If you do not use int it will consider as

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21197-2
03:39:25.198 --> 03:39:29.587
a string right?
So this is for converting the value to

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21197-3
03:39:29.587 --> 03:39:31.901
integer X convertible to int.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21211-0
03:39:32.461 --> 03:39:35.711
OK,
convert a number or a string to an

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21211-1
03:39:35.711 --> 03:39:39.461
integer. That's why we have used it.
Got it.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21213-0
03:39:39.621 --> 03:39:41.861
Oh, OK. OK. Thank you, Sir.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21214-0
03:39:41.861 --> 03:39:42.981
You're most welcome.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21271-0
03:42:20.541 --> 03:42:28.036
See you. I'm resolving one issue,
so you have to close it here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21271-1
03:42:28.036 --> 03:42:30.261
It's physics marks.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21273-0
03:42:32.141 --> 03:42:33.821
And then you would like to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21279-0
03:42:35.461 --> 03:42:38.621
Oh, because he means PSAT, right? Right,
right.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21292-0
03:42:39.621 --> 03:42:46.741
If with this one no else you have to
write this intent is important to OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21311-0
03:42:50.261 --> 03:43:00.547
This one should be. Yeah. Oh,
I mean the the spacing is very. Yes, yes,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21311-1
03:43:00.547 --> 03:43:03.261
yes. No, it's fine.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21314-0
03:43:04.581 --> 03:43:08.381
I see.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21324-0
03:43:15.821 --> 03:43:23.021
OK, sure. See here all of you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21326-0
03:43:24.101 --> 03:43:25.341
Then this one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21345-0
03:43:27.261 --> 03:43:35.773
So what you will do is you will run this
one Python operators dot PY enter OK

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21345-1
03:43:35.773 --> 03:43:40.901
access code.
Let me just comment to this part.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21359-0
03:43:43.221 --> 03:43:48.101
OK, because that one we already have done,
we know we don't want to run it again.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21366-0
03:43:51.381 --> 03:43:56.261
Kill the terminal delete. Oh,
here is view terminal.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21372-0
03:43:59.341 --> 03:44:02.741
OK, uh, here it is. You can run it again.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21386-0
03:44:03.901 --> 03:44:10.618
Uh, to run what we write, we write Python.
Then we will write our file name.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21386-1
03:44:10.618 --> 03:44:12.101
The file name is.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21393-0
03:44:13.861 --> 03:44:19.381
Raters dot PY enter so now.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21426-0
03:44:21.301 --> 03:44:29.028
Now you will like enter marks in physics
or if you want to make it more user

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21426-1
03:44:29.028 --> 03:44:36.252
friendly you can write this way.
Also here is colon tab or colon space,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21426-2
03:44:36.252 --> 03:44:38.861
just one space to be open.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21433-0
03:44:39.581 --> 03:44:46.181
Here is space. Here is space.
There go view terminal.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21440-0
03:44:47.701 --> 03:44:52.501
Uh, let me kill it again. View terminal.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21442-0
03:44:55.261 --> 03:44:55.301
Uh.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21445-0
03:44:59.181 --> 03:45:00.981
Operators.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21477-0
03:45:03.181 --> 03:45:08.092
dot Pi here is enter marks obtain in
physics.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21477-1
03:45:08.092 --> 03:45:16.633
For example in physics here I got 55,
in chemistry here I got the chemistry got

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21477-2
03:45:16.633 --> 03:45:18.661
the 40 and in math.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21479-0
03:45:18.901 --> 03:45:20.301
Hey, Cortana.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21480-0
03:45:22.261 --> 03:45:22.741
80.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21517-0
03:45:24.541 --> 03:45:31.900
So you have not go to the required marks.
Fine. You have not got the requirements.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21517-1
03:45:31.900 --> 03:45:36.510
Even you have got now this one.
I've read it again.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21517-2
03:45:36.510 --> 03:45:41.741
Enter marks in physics.
So you have entered, let's say 56.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21550-0
03:45:42.421 --> 03:45:50.686
In chemistry 58 and in maths 78.
So you have not got the required marks.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21550-1
03:45:50.686 --> 03:45:58.045
I have run it here in the physics.
See I get 65 in chemistry 50.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21550-2
03:45:58.045 --> 03:46:01.781
Chemistry is how much we need 50.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21581-0
03:46:03.621 --> 03:46:09.180
Chemistry we need 60.
So here it's create 67 in maths here I'll

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21581-1
03:46:09.180 --> 03:46:13.349
get 53 or 54.
So you are eligible to sit in the

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21581-2
03:46:13.349 --> 03:46:18.821
pre-exam of MVBS. Fine.
So if he or she fulfills the criteria.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21585-0
03:46:19.061 --> 03:46:21.821
Then only it will do so this is.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21590-0
03:46:31.421 --> 03:46:34.141
Sorry, I don't get scroll up.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21592-0
03:46:39.461 --> 03:46:40.501
Terminal.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21593-0
03:46:42.101 --> 03:46:42.141
I.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21594-0
03:46:43.301 --> 03:46:43.341
Oh.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21612-0
03:46:45.581 --> 03:46:50.020
Get the number is all more than since
they give you the but but it's not

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21612-1
03:46:50.020 --> 03:46:52.757
working. Huh.
You say greater than equal to,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21612-2
03:46:52.757 --> 03:46:55.554
greater than equal to,
greater than equal to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21612-3
03:46:55.554 --> 03:46:59.141
You have read less than equal to or
greater than equal to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21623-0
03:47:01.381 --> 03:47:05.682
OK, OK, I will check. I will check.
I will check folder.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21623-1
03:47:05.682 --> 03:47:07.341
Let me check our code.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21628-0
03:47:08.901 --> 03:47:14.741
Huh. Second dumper. All exceeding,
but still not edible, yeah.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21666-0
03:47:18.141 --> 03:47:23.502
The one that it is able and the second
example is all exceeding the marks,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21666-1
03:47:23.502 --> 03:47:28.791
but it's still saying not eligible. No,
where it's it's showing eligible.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21666-2
03:47:28.791 --> 03:47:33.150
See here. Why are you saying that?
I don't get it. See here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21666-3
03:47:33.150 --> 03:47:37.581
I think they are missing the same thing.
Hey, hey, hey, here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21693-0
03:47:37.661 --> 03:47:43.143
See, you want eligible thing, right?
I will show you. See here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21693-1
03:47:43.143 --> 03:47:48.711
I have run this one right.
I think I thought that you are asking

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21693-2
03:47:48.711 --> 03:47:54.021
about your code. My my code is correct.
See here. Here we go.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21722-0
03:47:54.301 --> 03:48:00.161
Under marks obtained in physics. Fine.
So in physics for example,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21722-1
03:48:00.161 --> 03:48:05.222
he have entered 57,
so greater than 57 is correct. Fine.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21722-2
03:48:05.222 --> 03:48:09.661
In chemistry he have entered,
let's say 65, fine.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21729-0
03:48:09.781 --> 03:48:13.301
And in mathematics he have got,
let's say 53.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21730-0
03:48:14.981 --> 03:48:15.381
Fine.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21740-0
03:48:17.661 --> 03:48:23.141
You are you are eligible to sit in pre
exam of MBBS. It's correct.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21741-0
03:48:25.781 --> 03:48:25.941
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21745-0
03:48:27.741 --> 03:48:29.861
Not less than, greater than.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21764-0
03:48:31.301 --> 03:48:38.674
Maths greater than equal to 50.
This is this is math equal to 50.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21764-1
03:48:38.674 --> 03:48:43.701
You greater than.
It should be greater than.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21795-0
03:48:44.861 --> 03:48:49.952
What you are thinking?
You have not write the code. It's correct.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21795-1
03:48:49.952 --> 03:48:54.734
It's only that because the way you write
it is the chemistry.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21795-2
03:48:54.734 --> 03:49:00.673
But in terms of logic, it's not you put.
Yeah, Max first and then it's fine.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21795-3
03:49:00.673 --> 03:49:03.141
Whatever you will write, that's.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21827-0
03:49:08.221 --> 03:49:13.785
You want me to write this one first?
You can write this. I don't know. It's OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21827-1
03:49:13.785 --> 03:49:18.445
You want in the same order.
So order is not important. Yeah, I am.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21827-2
03:49:18.445 --> 03:49:23.661
The thing is it's good if we are make
this way. So order is not important.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21864-0
03:49:23.661 --> 03:49:27.612
It will take the value to store the value
and from there it will take.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21864-1
03:49:27.612 --> 03:49:30.395
Here is whatever the order.
That's not necessary.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21864-2
03:49:30.395 --> 03:49:34.234
You will take in the same order that you
have read in the logic. OK,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21864-3
03:49:34.234 --> 03:49:38.519
but if you want I can write it here.
This is math and physics and chemistry,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21864-4
03:49:38.519 --> 03:49:40.021
but order is not important.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21886-0
03:49:40.301 --> 03:49:45.163
It's perfectly fine earlier also and this
time also under marks in this one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21886-1
03:49:45.163 --> 03:49:48.951
The same way you can write.
Now it will ask for math first,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21886-2
03:49:48.951 --> 03:49:53.181
then it will ask for chemistry,
then then physics, then chemistry.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21892-0
03:49:57.421 --> 03:50:00.981
You were a bit terrible to your order.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21894-0
03:50:04.501 --> 03:50:05.061
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21895-0
03:50:11.221 --> 03:50:11.781
All good.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21902-0
03:50:12.861 --> 03:50:20.781
End of the day, not end of the day.
Now it's your turn, huh?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21925-0
03:50:22.141 --> 03:50:28.279
First day, you know we get.
I get the idea about this.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21925-1
03:50:28.279 --> 03:50:33.859
No see in first day.
If you guys able to connect,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21925-2
03:50:33.859 --> 03:50:37.541
that means I'm successful, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21960-0
03:50:38.821 --> 03:50:42.440
The day one,
if you are able to connect a bit with

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21960-1
03:50:42.440 --> 03:50:47.902
this one means you you are able to
connect how what the things we are doing,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21960-2
03:50:47.902 --> 03:50:51.024
how we are writing,
what are the file name,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21960-3
03:50:51.024 --> 03:50:55.564
how we are compiling.
If this much also you have learned today,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21960-4
03:50:55.564 --> 03:50:57.621
that's enough for me because.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21996-0
03:50:58.061 --> 03:51:03.848
Gradually you will understand each and
every how to write the code, this, that.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21996-1
03:51:03.848 --> 03:51:09.346
So at least this part you all should know
today. You all know, right? Yeah,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21996-2
03:51:09.346 --> 03:51:14.627
this much. So that's the thing.
This is the that's why I told you I have

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/21996-3
03:51:14.627 --> 03:51:16.941
started it very from very basic.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22037-0
03:51:18.461 --> 03:51:22.588
From very basic from the scratch from
zero,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22037-1
03:51:22.588 --> 03:51:29.996
you can say -1 from where I have started.
So then you know that zero line 0123

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22037-2
03:51:29.996 --> 03:51:35.341
decimal lines,
you know 0123 and that side -1 -, 2 -, 3.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22040-0
03:51:35.901 --> 03:51:38.501
I don't know, Matt. OK, fine.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22065-0
03:51:41.381 --> 03:51:45.923
Number lines, you know, number lines.
There's a number lines.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22065-1
03:51:45.923 --> 03:51:51.489
You have 0 and the left hand side is
minus and the right hand side is plus,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22065-2
03:51:51.489 --> 03:51:52.661
right, you know.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22069-0
03:51:54.141 --> 03:51:57.541
It will be my English is not that good,
huh? OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22070-0
03:52:00.181 --> 03:52:00.341
Oh.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22072-0
03:52:05.981 --> 03:52:06.461
Yes.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22073-0
03:52:08.741 --> 03:52:08.821
Oh.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22091-0
03:52:10.461 --> 03:52:14.580
Yes,
this one is and let's see or and note

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22091-1
03:52:14.580 --> 03:52:18.794
both.
Sure this one is logical operator and

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22091-2
03:52:18.794 --> 03:52:24.061
example we have done.
You want or note as well, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22093-0
03:52:25.621 --> 03:52:25.741
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22095-0
03:52:36.421 --> 03:52:37.381
We'll see or.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22100-0
03:53:04.381 --> 03:53:05.341
Here it is.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22103-0
03:53:10.421 --> 03:53:11.901
ID proof.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22108-0
03:53:13.461 --> 03:53:15.861
We are right here input.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22117-0
03:53:18.781 --> 03:53:21.821
Online team, what about you?
Everything is fine up to now.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22119-0
03:53:26.461 --> 03:53:28.501
Is everything fine?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22149-0
03:53:29.661 --> 03:53:36.362
Just thank you. Great. No,
I want to all of you also be engaged,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22124-0
03:53:30.661 --> 03:53:30.781
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22149-1
03:53:36.362 --> 03:53:41.310
right?
So because they are physically available

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22149-2
03:53:41.310 --> 03:53:47.701
here, so that's why I'm asking you once.
So here is ID proof.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22150-0
03:53:54.661 --> 03:53:54.901
Enter.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22152-0
03:53:57.141 --> 03:53:58.341
ID proof.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22154-0
03:53:59.821 --> 03:54:00.861
You have.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22157-0
03:54:04.101 --> 03:54:05.541
Here we have rate.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22158-0
03:54:08.781 --> 03:54:09.301
If.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22160-0
03:54:11.821 --> 03:54:13.021
ID proof.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22172-0
03:54:16.701 --> 03:54:22.461
For example,
we want to allow only these things if ID

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22172-1
03:54:22.461 --> 03:54:24.381
proof is equal to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22173-0
03:54:25.541 --> 03:54:26.261
122.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22175-0
03:54:28.901 --> 03:54:29.421
Passport.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22176-0
03:54:33.061 --> 03:54:33.221
Or.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22178-0
03:54:35.461 --> 03:54:36.661
ID proof.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22191-0
03:54:37.981 --> 03:54:45.861
Let me write 4. Sorry,
other language will come out or ID proof.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22194-0
03:54:47.021 --> 03:54:49.821
Is equal to equal to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22198-0
03:54:52.261 --> 03:54:57.021
Let's say DL driving license.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22199-0
03:55:00.741 --> 03:55:00.901
BL.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22200-0
03:55:02.821 --> 03:55:02.981
Or.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22206-0
03:55:08.181 --> 03:55:09.461
Any other ID proof you guys have?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22207-0
03:55:11.381 --> 03:55:12.701
Any other?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22212-0
03:55:15.861 --> 03:55:18.661
Huh. Voter ID, huh?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22214-0
03:55:26.901 --> 03:55:28.021
Voter ID.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22227-0
03:55:36.781 --> 03:55:40.224
I have write 3.
You can write more if you want.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22227-1
03:55:40.224 --> 03:55:43.021
Just three I have write. Here is print.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22228-0
03:55:48.021 --> 03:55:49.061
Valued.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22229-0
03:55:50.701 --> 03:55:51.501
ID.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22234-0
03:56:15.621 --> 03:56:17.501
We accept.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22235-0
03:56:19.021 --> 03:56:19.301
Yes.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22236-0
03:56:20.901 --> 03:56:21.061
Else.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22239-0
03:56:51.381 --> 03:56:51.541
Only.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22241-0
03:56:52.661 --> 03:56:53.141
Passport.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22242-0
03:56:58.021 --> 03:56:58.901
DL.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22247-0
03:57:02.901 --> 03:57:04.621
And what writing?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22248-0
03:57:07.701 --> 03:57:08.261
On.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22250-0
03:57:10.021 --> 03:57:10.941
Accepted.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22251-0
03:57:13.541 --> 03:57:13.621
As.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22253-0
03:57:15.821 --> 03:57:16.741
ID proof.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22256-0
03:57:31.461 --> 03:57:31.661
And.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22259-0
03:57:42.901 --> 03:57:44.421
I do proof.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22263-0
03:57:49.301 --> 03:57:52.581
Is not valid ID here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22291-0
03:57:55.981 --> 03:57:59.382
That's it.
Do you want to check the ID proof?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22291-1
03:57:59.382 --> 03:58:04.409
If you have the passport,
you have the DL or you have the voter ID.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22291-2
03:58:04.409 --> 03:58:10.101
So we'll say a valid ID. We accept here,
right? Whatever out of these three.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22320-0
03:58:11.581 --> 03:58:18.158
Hence only passport DL and voter ID are
accepted as identity proof.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22320-1
03:58:18.158 --> 03:58:23.767
So this is or either you have passport or
DL or voter ID.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22320-2
03:58:23.767 --> 03:58:26.861
Any of these if any of these is.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22341-0
03:58:27.381 --> 03:58:31.550
You have. If any of the condition is true,
it is true.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22341-1
03:58:31.550 --> 03:58:37.461
If none of these means all of these false,
then it will be false only, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22353-0
03:58:38.701 --> 03:58:42.451
Out of three,
if any of the things you have,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22353-1
03:58:42.451 --> 03:58:44.701
this is known as or got it.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22355-0
03:58:46.181 --> 03:58:46.781
This is odd.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22361-0
03:58:48.501 --> 03:58:52.061
Or means any of the condition is true
means true.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22396-0
03:58:56.541 --> 03:59:01.536
And the example I already have told you
this is the example right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22396-1
03:59:01.536 --> 03:59:05.935
See if you have any of the ID proof,
any of this voter ID,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22396-2
03:59:05.935 --> 03:59:11.601
either passport or the this one DL.
