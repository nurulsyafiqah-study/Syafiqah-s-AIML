00:00:11.185 --> 00:00:13.825
Or this or this. Any of this is true.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22473-0
00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:20.225
Either you have the passport that means
accepted, you have the DL also accepted.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22473-1
00:00:20.225 --> 00:00:25.598
If you have voter ID it's accepted any of
these earlier I have told you and and

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22473-2
00:00:25.598 --> 00:00:29.225
means all the condition must match in or
any of this.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22475-0
00:00:30.745 --> 00:00:31.785
Even a single one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22495-0
00:02:33.345 --> 00:02:33.465
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22498-0
00:02:48.305 --> 00:02:54.025
I think that's different.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22500-0
00:03:05.105 --> 00:03:05.225
Yes.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22503-0
00:03:10.825 --> 00:03:16.025
Do it fast, all of you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22516-0
00:03:47.545 --> 00:03:49.785
Don't you might be helping.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22519-0
00:03:55.345 --> 00:04:00.105
I didn't know.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22521-0
00:04:12.465 --> 00:04:12.625
8.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22528-0
00:04:14.705 --> 00:04:25.781
No,
we just reverse of that one should not be

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22528-1
00:04:25.781 --> 00:04:26.985
that.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22529-0
00:04:28.625 --> 00:04:29.305
Goodbye.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22530-0
00:04:31.385 --> 00:04:31.505
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22532-0
00:04:38.865 --> 00:04:39.625
So.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22536-0
00:04:44.945 --> 00:04:45.225
Start.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22537-0
00:04:51.545 --> 00:04:51.705
2.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22538-0
00:04:52.505 --> 00:04:52.665
2.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22547-0
00:05:07.825 --> 00:05:11.545
See here we want to check this one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22549-0
00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:23.905
Uh.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22576-0
00:05:27.265 --> 00:05:33.239
Enter ID proof you have.
For example I have entered here voter ID

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22576-1
00:05:33.239 --> 00:05:40.753
so valid ID voter ID we accept here right?
If for example I have run it and I have

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22576-2
00:05:40.753 --> 00:05:42.745
right here stored and.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22578-0
00:05:42.825 --> 00:05:43.425
Student.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22580-0
00:05:45.025 --> 00:05:45.825
ID.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22611-0
00:05:47.345 --> 00:05:51.510
So only passport,
DL and voter ID are accepted as identity

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22611-1
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.040
proof.
The student ID is not valid ID here. Fine.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22611-2
00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.065
You have entered.
Let's say you have entered here DL so.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22614-0
00:06:01.785 --> 00:06:05.065
Under your deal, sorry.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22632-0
00:06:07.585 --> 00:06:11.318
I know why it's giving because I have put
one space here,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22632-1
00:06:11.318 --> 00:06:13.185
so valid IDDL we accept here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22634-0
00:06:14.105 --> 00:06:14.225
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22640-0
00:06:16.945 --> 00:06:19.865
Just to space put our space on.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22655-0
00:07:42.505 --> 00:07:43.865
Then.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22657-0
00:07:45.265 --> 00:07:45.665
I love you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22660-0
00:07:55.785 --> 00:07:56.585
See a note.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22661-0
00:08:00.905 --> 00:08:01.545
Done.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22671-0
00:08:05.065 --> 00:08:10.619
Should I show you a note as well,
or do you want to leave? Leave.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22671-1
00:08:10.619 --> 00:08:11.545
Definitely.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22672-0
00:08:14.425 --> 00:08:14.585
Huh.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22712-0
00:08:19.345 --> 00:08:24.921
So let's do this is not one and then
after that we can. OK, sure. Is it fine?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22712-1
00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:28.210
Just this logical one will finish, right?
OK,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22712-2
00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:33.214
the send or not only I'm giving just two
minutes, not more than that.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22712-3
00:08:33.214 --> 00:08:35.145
So here is we have entered.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22720-0
00:08:35.505 --> 00:08:41.207
In 2 minutes I will finish. No issue.
We'll just check control C I'll copy it

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22720-1
00:08:41.207 --> 00:08:41.865
paste it.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22736-0
00:08:43.545 --> 00:08:48.272
We have taken mark,
enter the marks in maths and we have

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22736-1
00:08:48.272 --> 00:08:52.585
right here one more thing that's right is
gap year.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22738-0
00:08:59.705 --> 00:09:00.825
Up here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22740-0
00:09:07.345 --> 00:09:07.665
Enter.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22741-0
00:09:13.465 --> 00:09:13.705
Oops.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22746-0
00:09:21.665 --> 00:09:26.785
Year gap, if any, otherwise 0.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22768-0
00:09:32.185 --> 00:09:39.058
Right input enter year gap if any
otherwise zero means if you don't have

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22768-1
00:09:39.058 --> 00:09:42.825
the gap you can it see so if math marks.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22772-0
00:09:44.385 --> 00:09:47.945
Greater than 12 to 60.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22774-0
00:09:50.585 --> 00:09:50.905
Note.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22776-0
00:09:55.425 --> 00:09:56.425
Year gap.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22778-0
00:09:58.865 --> 00:10:00.185
Drop beer.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22782-0
00:10:01.345 --> 00:10:03.305
The return than equal to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22783-0
00:10:04.345 --> 00:10:04.505
2.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22794-0
00:10:58.985 --> 00:10:59.145

So did you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22814-0
00:12:44.545 --> 00:12:47.985
Eligible for Vtech.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22815-0
00:12:50.745 --> 00:12:50.985
Thanks.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22817-0
00:13:01.425 --> 00:13:02.185
Legible.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22818-0
00:13:04.105 --> 00:13:04.185
Oh.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22819-0
00:13:06.625 --> 00:13:07.385
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22829-0
00:13:12.065 --> 00:13:16.865
This one we have,
so Gabriel should not be equal to 0.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22830-0
00:13:17.865 --> 00:13:17.905
Oh.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22833-0
00:13:20.705 --> 00:13:23.145
Or if it is 0 then fine.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22837-0
00:13:30.225 --> 00:13:32.305
There should be no gap in between.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22863-0
00:14:53.305 --> 00:14:57.400
You can write it this way or you can
write note zero as well. It's up to you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22863-1
00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.185
You can write it this way as well.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22865-0
00:15:00.745 --> 00:15:01.105
Note 0.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22871-0
00:15:05.105 --> 00:15:08.105
It's not working.
I'll just write the note the part of it.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22876-0
00:15:10.585 --> 00:15:12.465
Here is view terminal.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22902-0
00:15:14.385 --> 00:15:19.819
Here is Python operators dot PA under
marks obtained mathematics.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22902-1
00:15:19.819 --> 00:15:24.265
Let's see I have entered 56 and here is
the gap year.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22909-0
00:15:25.665 --> 00:15:29.745
I have entered here, let's say two,
so eligible for B.Tech.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22910-0
00:15:32.025 --> 00:15:32.185

Strong, strong, strong, strong.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22923-0

00:15:56.465 --> 00:15:58.945
Or we let yes.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22940-0
00:15:59.105 --> 00:16:02.421
So I'm sorry,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22950-0
00:16:04.425 --> 00:16:07.545
Oh yes, you guys can leave just here.
We'll use all OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22957-0

Thank you, Sir.
Thank you for today speech. Thank you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22953-0
00:16:10.305 --> 00:16:11.145
They're the most.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22983-0
00:16:13.985 --> 00:16:17.697
All of you.
So if it is less than this one or gap

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22983-1
00:16:17.697 --> 00:16:22.003
here is not equal to 0.
In any case you are not eligible.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22983-2
00:16:22.003 --> 00:16:24.825
You should use or no time here, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22991-0
00:16:27.185 --> 00:16:30.785
Fine. If you guys want to leave,
you can leave now, OK?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/22994-0
00:16:32.665 --> 00:16:33.945
We'll finish.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23041-0
00:16:40.825 --> 00:16:47.100
We have terminal now it will be fine.
See I have right and so here is Python

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23041-1
00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:52.806
operators marks we have rate 45,
the gap we have rate let's say is 0.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23041-2
00:16:52.806 --> 00:16:58.185
So here is not eligible.
We have entered here marks let's say 67.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23066-0
00:16:58.545 --> 00:17:03.406
We have rate gap here is 3,
so that's also not eligible, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23066-1
00:17:03.406 --> 00:17:09.634
And we this one we have rate here we have
rate 56 gap year we have rate 0 so this

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23066-2
00:17:09.634 --> 00:17:11.305
one eligible for VTAC.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23078-0
00:17:15.105 --> 00:17:19.205
And just write this one because zero that
zero word. It's confusing.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23078-1
00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:21.225
We'll write this one. That's fine.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23114-0
00:17:28.065 --> 00:17:33.492
Good. I'm doing a gap. Oh, how is it? Huh.
I think you get what you mean by I think

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23114-1
00:17:33.492 --> 00:17:36.723
you get.
Here gap means for example you have been

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23114-2
00:17:36.723 --> 00:17:40.277
10 + 2 and after that you are sitting two
years ideal.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23114-3
00:17:40.277 --> 00:17:43.185
So there should not be any gap between
them.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23153-0
00:17:43.265 --> 00:17:50.991
I see that that's also for example you
have passed your 10 + 2IN 2013 and then

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23153-1
00:17:50.991 --> 00:17:56.566
there is the gap of two years gap 2015
you are applying.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23153-2
00:17:56.566 --> 00:18:02.825
So there is 2 years gap in building.
So that gap we don't want.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23163-0
00:18:03.265 --> 00:18:08.514
So you want to be less than we want the
air gap should not be any means the same

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23163-1
00:18:08.514 --> 00:18:09.745
year you can apply.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23165-0
00:18:12.145 --> 00:18:13.785
That there will be the zero only.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23167-0
00:18:15.945 --> 00:18:16.385
Got it?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23185-0
00:18:21.265 --> 00:18:26.807
There should be no gap in between.
You see that few companies give that

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23185-1
00:18:26.807 --> 00:18:30.425
there should be no gap in your this
academics.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23186-0
00:18:32.905 --> 00:18:33.305
Hello.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23188-0
00:18:39.985 --> 00:18:42.425
That note word, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23232-0
00:18:45.945 --> 00:18:50.091
No, it will not work here.
That's the different thing that you are

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23232-1
00:18:50.091 --> 00:18:53.062
asking. You not zero. This one you want,
right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23232-2
00:18:53.062 --> 00:18:56.714
So that's the different example I will
show you right now.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23232-3
00:18:56.714 --> 00:19:00.737
You'll do this way only.
That's the not you want to use the word

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23232-4
00:19:00.737 --> 00:19:03.151
one.
That's why I will show you in the

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23232-5
00:19:03.151 --> 00:19:04.265
different example.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23236-0
00:19:04.705 --> 00:19:06.825
We'll do up to this love.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23244-0
00:19:10.305 --> 00:19:14.905
I could not when I try to. You try to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23246-0
00:19:17.665 --> 00:19:18.305
It's not working.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23249-0
00:19:25.265 --> 00:19:25.705
Let me check.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23259-0
00:19:29.665 --> 00:19:38.586
It's your. You don't want to go.
I only have. I'm done. Yeah, yes,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23259-1
00:19:38.586 --> 00:19:39.785
I'm done.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23260-0
00:19:42.465 --> 00:19:49.105
I'm just kidding.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23262-0
00:19:57.705 --> 00:19:58.585
That means.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23265-0
00:20:06.665 --> 00:20:08.025
I'm not.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23266-0
00:20:16.065 --> 00:20:26.465
I thought we are doing today.
I think they're out of them.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23272-0
00:20:45.825 --> 00:20:52.745
That's correct.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23287-0
00:20:55.545 --> 00:21:04.564
It should be all. So we're not using.
I'm gonna try to use,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23287-1
00:21:04.564 --> 00:21:09.825
but you can't use it like this one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23307-0
00:21:11.425 --> 00:21:16.902
And if you are not given the value for
this thing, so then you can use the node.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23307-1
00:21:16.902 --> 00:21:20.825
So that will be the different example
altogether. OK, OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23320-0
00:21:22.385 --> 00:21:26.310
In this one you can't use that note.
Here you can't use that note.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23320-1
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:28.185
For example you have taken here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23324-0
00:21:29.825 --> 00:21:32.145
Let me show her name.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23327-0
00:21:34.025 --> 00:21:34.665
Input.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23331-0
00:21:39.545 --> 00:21:42.385
Enter user name.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23334-0
00:21:45.705 --> 00:21:47.905
Oh, here it is if.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23337-0
00:21:49.905 --> 00:21:51.305
Not name.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23339-0
00:21:53.545 --> 00:21:55.025
We have right here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23348-0
00:21:58.145 --> 00:22:02.905
I'm sorry, this one will not work.
This is C# port print.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23349-0
00:22:05.065 --> 00:22:05.385
Note.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23353-0
00:22:07.305 --> 00:22:09.705

Mean.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23360-0
00:22:39.065 --> 00:22:39.305
Welcome.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23364-0
00:22:42.225 --> 00:22:46.425
Fine view terminal.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23371-0
00:22:52.585 --> 00:22:56.265
You have not given the name,
it showed you there no.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23372-0
00:22:57.665 --> 00:22:57.945
Sam.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23378-0
00:22:59.465 --> 00:23:01.865
Got it. This is a note.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23393-0
00:23:03.265 --> 00:23:07.985
If it is, it doesn't have the value,
it will show you the.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23393-1
00:23:07.985 --> 00:23:11.505
I will show you both.
So now you can sleep.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23422-0
00:23:13.225 --> 00:23:19.925
Aaron is here is that's why.
Otherwise tomorrow she will not come.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23422-1
00:23:19.925 --> 00:23:28.125
You have not resolved my issue. I can't.
I can't sleep. No, it's fine. It's fine.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23422-2
00:23:28.125 --> 00:23:31.025
It's totally fine. It's good.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23425-0
00:23:32.465 --> 00:23:33.465
That's the.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23467-0
00:23:36.625 --> 00:23:42.344
I can understand because I last night I
came late. That flight was delayed.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23467-1
00:23:42.344 --> 00:23:46.633
I came around 2:00,
so I can't sleep from Air India from

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23467-2
00:23:46.633 --> 00:23:50.697
India to Air.
So I can't sleep properly because I go,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23467-3
00:23:50.697 --> 00:23:53.105
I check in at 2:00 in the hotel.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23477-0
00:23:54.945 --> 00:24:02.997

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23481-0
00:24:06.225 --> 00:24:09.585
Though the capital of India,
the heart of India.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/23483-0
00:24:14.345 --> 00:24:14.505

aren't able to sleep. OK, fine guys.
