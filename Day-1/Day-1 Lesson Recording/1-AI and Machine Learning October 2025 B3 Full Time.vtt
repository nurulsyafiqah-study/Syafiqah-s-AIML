Good morning. OK. Can you hear my slide?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/413-0
00:48:42.973 --> 00:48:45.829
Fine. So let's begin.
I am Mohammed Salman.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/413-1
00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:50.633
I'm going to give my introduction first,
then I I will give you the time,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/413-2
00:48:50.633 --> 00:48:54.333
all of you guys,
that you can introduce yourself, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/415-0
00:49:00.253 --> 00:49:01.173
So let's begin.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/448-0
00:49:04.573 --> 00:49:10.509
So hi, I'm Mohammed Salwan.
I have almost 20 years of experience in

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/448-1
00:49:10.509 --> 00:49:14.786
this industry.
I have started my career in 2006.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/448-2
00:49:14.786 --> 00:49:20.373
My highest qualification is MCA Master of
Computer Application.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/484-0
00:49:20.733 --> 00:49:24.739
I'm a Microsoft Certified Trainer.
It is known as MCG.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/484-1
00:49:24.739 --> 00:49:30.056
I'm a Microsoft Certified Solution
Developer as well and during these 20

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/484-2
00:49:30.056 --> 00:49:35.810
years I have conducted the training in
various organization in India like IBM,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/484-3
00:49:35.810 --> 00:49:37.413
Emphasis, Newhole and.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/498-0
00:49:38.653 --> 00:49:45.450
Panamor and many more overseas I have
done for Dubai, Sharjah, Oman,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/498-1
00:49:45.450 --> 00:49:51.853
Philippines, US, UK and the in Malaysia.
This is the second one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/499-0
00:49:54.053 --> 00:49:54.773
No.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/519-0
00:50:02.093 --> 00:50:07.033
So in this particular training we are
going to discuss about the Python and

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/519-1
00:50:07.033 --> 00:50:09.373
then we will discuss about the AIML.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/562-0
00:50:11.533 --> 00:50:18.681
So we will start from the Python first.
What is Python? How to install,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/562-1
00:50:18.681 --> 00:50:26.822
how to start writing the codes and later
on we will go then the machine learning,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/562-2
00:50:26.822 --> 00:50:30.893
AIML, all these advanced concept as well.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/609-0
00:50:31.053 --> 00:50:35.352
So we'll start from scratch.
If you have the idea about the

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/609-1
00:50:35.352 --> 00:50:40.296
programming language, that's good.
If you don't have even so you can

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/609-2
00:50:40.296 --> 00:50:45.240
understand each and everything,
we will start from the zero from the

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/609-3
00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:45.813
scratch.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/643-0
00:50:46.653 --> 00:50:52.766
And we will go up to the advanced level,
right. So this is about me.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/643-1
00:50:52.766 --> 00:50:56.665
So now I'm going you the chance one by
one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/643-2
00:50:56.665 --> 00:51:00.917
You guys can introduce yourself as well,
right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/643-3
00:51:00.917 --> 00:51:04.373
Then we will start the technical stuff.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/647-0
00:51:04.373 --> 00:51:08.933
Right. So we'll start from you. Uh, yes.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/674-0
00:51:13.093 --> 00:51:17.940
My name is no Arila.
You can call me Arila.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/674-1
00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:23.227
So briefly I work in India as an
automation IT.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/674-2
00:51:23.227 --> 00:51:27.413
So just trying to learn something new.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/695-0
00:51:28.413 --> 00:51:32.537
Like,
what do you know in computer science,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/695-1
00:51:32.537 --> 00:51:37.411
Lila? Sorry,
what do you know till now in computers

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/695-2
00:51:37.411 --> 00:51:42.847
coding? Yes, yeah,
I have a basic coding that I linked in

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/695-3
00:51:42.847 --> 00:51:44.253
the university.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/713-0
00:51:44.533 --> 00:51:50.414
During my work I didn't do a bunch of
coding, but I we do read the coding.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/713-1
00:51:50.414 --> 00:51:54.413
We need to automate the issue,
automate the issue.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/714-0
00:51:55.693 --> 00:51:55.773
Bye.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/751-0
00:51:59.813 --> 00:52:06.293
Who's next? You. Yes. Hello. Good morning,
everyone. My name is.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/751-1
00:52:06.293 --> 00:52:13.371
You can call me in shot. Well,
previously I was working as a executive

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/751-2
00:52:13.371 --> 00:52:18.056
secretary,
so since I already had my contract,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/751-3
00:52:18.056 --> 00:52:19.253
so I get it.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/757-0
00:52:19.293 --> 00:52:23.853
Get it trans to be in this class this AI
already uh.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/797-0
00:52:25.893 --> 00:52:30.700
Because it's under a scholarship.
So I just want to grab that opportunity.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/797-1
00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:35.314
The reason why that I'm coming to the
class is because I am thinking of

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/797-2
00:52:35.314 --> 00:52:39.929
privating my career. I I just,
I feel that right now the job demand for

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/797-3
00:52:39.929 --> 00:52:42.813
me covered that that this is really,
really.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/840-0
00:52:43.093 --> 00:52:46.987
Tremendous.
So that's the reason why I come and join

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/840-1
00:52:46.987 --> 00:52:51.837
and I just want to learn from this seat.
So in terms of computer,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/840-2
00:52:51.837 --> 00:52:57.202
I might say that I'm very good in
Microsoft only because that is what my

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/840-3
00:52:57.202 --> 00:53:02.125
job requires and everything.
So if you're asking me for something,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/840-4
00:53:02.125 --> 00:53:02.493
I am.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/866-0
00:53:02.653 --> 00:53:08.147
Very, very zero knowledge.
So I'm happy to learn from the scratch

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/866-1
00:53:08.147 --> 00:53:13.226
and hopefully that our,
I mean our kids can succeed to to to

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/866-2
00:53:13.226 --> 00:53:15.973
learn this program until the end.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/888-0
00:53:17.293 --> 00:53:23.673
You're fine. Thanks. OK.

00:53:32.693 --> 00:53:34.813
My background's chemical engineer.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/919-0
00:53:35.773 --> 00:53:41.369
In oil and gas I exposed to coding and
programming.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/919-1
00:53:41.369 --> 00:53:48.796
I was earlier coding for advanced control
system for plant refinery,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/919-2
00:53:48.796 --> 00:53:50.733
but there's still.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/946-0
00:53:51.133 --> 00:53:56.299

00:53:56.299 --> 00:54:05.093
So I'm I'm intend to use AI and coding to
further enhance my consultancy works.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/947-0
00:54:06.733 --> 00:54:06.933
Yep.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/975-0
00:54:11.693 --> 00:54:17.275
Hi, my name is. You guys can call me.
I just I am from UUN.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/975-1
00:54:17.275 --> 00:54:21.369
My course degree is IT majoring in
network.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/975-2
00:54:21.369 --> 00:54:28.533
So I just finished my sheet last month.
So I'm here today because I want to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/1002-0
00:54:29.053 --> 00:54:43.365
Hello, my name is. You can call me Cosy.
My background is on the stick and right

00:54:43.365 --> 00:54:47.253
now I want to explore.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/1008-0
00:54:47.813 --> 00:54:52.690
Um,
for the I think I want to be tell me that

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/1008-1
00:54:52.690 --> 00:54:56.613
that this Monday, but that's what we.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/1032-0

00:55:18.413 --> 00:55:30.379
So I think I have to learn on AI for the
sake of testing me towards making a good

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/1043-1
00:55:30.379 --> 00:55:31.693
decision.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/1064-0
00:55:37.093 --> 00:55:45.961
It's not actually previous now was the my
my is marine science and technology and I

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/1064-1
00:55:45.961 --> 00:55:52.613
was a Geo data analyst and finally I'm
adding AI and ML to my.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/1088-0
00:55:53.053 --> 00:55:58.874
For you and then I hope uh for the next I

So this one also you need to read out
somewhere this introduction as well.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/1099-0
00:56:08.573 --> 00:56:11.897
OK,
what's your computer science knowledge?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/1099-1
00:56:11.897 --> 00:56:14.693
What do you know in computer science?

01:16:41.027 --> 01:16:50.293
fun fact, I'm also I'm alumni of Nextbird.
Previously a few years back I've learned.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/2349-0
01:16:52.053 --> 01:16:57.773
I get into the program for data science
uh with Python.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/2352-0
01:16:58.613 --> 01:17:00.093

01:17:13.333 --> 01:17:19.978
So few days we will start from scratch
because you see the the lot of persons

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/2408-1
01:17:19.978 --> 01:17:26.878
are from the non IT background or they
don't have the idea about the Pythons and

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/2408-2
01:17:26.878 --> 01:17:30.627

But later on in advanced stuff you can

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/2408-3

Then after that you will run this command.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/3665-0

Fine,
just these two things we need for these

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4238-1
01:47:27.704 --> 01:47:33.984
early 5-10 days and after that the other
software ones we need we will install.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4238-2
01:47:33.984 --> 01:47:38.773
So once you do this setup we can start
doing the code right.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4242-0
01:47:41.733 --> 01:47:45.373
Then this installation as well,
all of you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4243-0
01:47:52.133 --> 01:47:52.253
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4244-0
01:47:59.573 --> 01:47:59.813
Finish.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4271-0
01:48:02.333 --> 01:48:07.041
All the boxes, right? Yes.
So once you see this is your pipe,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4271-1
01:48:07.041 --> 01:48:11.217
let me just because in my case there is a
lot of code,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4271-2
01:48:11.217 --> 01:48:15.773
so I will show you from the scratch.
So what we will do is.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4275-0
01:48:17.253 --> 01:48:20.173
I'm going to create one folder for you
guys.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4277-0
01:48:21.293 --> 01:48:23.133
Here it is. Uh.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4280-0
01:48:25.133 --> 01:48:26.933
New folder.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4289-0
01:48:29.013 --> 01:48:32.813
And what is your training name?
Let me just check.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4292-0
01:48:37.373 --> 01:48:38.813
What's your name?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4298-0
01:48:41.453 --> 01:48:44.093
I'm giving the name this one is.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4301-0
01:48:45.253 --> 01:48:47.173
IEIML.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4316-0
01:48:48.573 --> 01:48:53.795
Fine and here is I have created one
folder,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4316-1
01:48:53.795 --> 01:48:59.373
new folder and folder name is day one day
one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4353-0
01:49:01.133 --> 01:49:04.345
Right,
so this way we will create every day.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4353-1
01:49:04.345 --> 01:49:09.485
For example, today's the day one,
so we'll write all the content inside

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4353-2
01:49:09.485 --> 01:49:13.197
this folder, right?
So this folder we have created,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4353-3
01:49:13.197 --> 01:49:15.053

Here is show more options.
Here is open with code.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4390-1
01:49:21.121 --> 01:49:27.452
Have you got this option? All of you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4390-2
01:49:27.452 --> 01:49:31.733
Inside that folder we have created one
more D1.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4415-0
01:49:32.173 --> 01:49:37.247
And then we have right click here.
Here is show more options.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4415-1
01:49:37.247 --> 01:49:41.912

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4430-0
01:49:51.813 --> 01:49:54.353
You have reached on VS code.
You just close the VS code.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4430-1
01:49:54.353 --> 01:49:56.493
I will show you the Windows code what
we'll do.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4457-0
01:49:57.453 --> 01:50:02.941
Let's go to that section.

01:50:09.953 --> 01:50:14.933
This can be open. No,
this option is not coming.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4475-0
01:50:16.093 --> 01:50:21.978
See here you will go here.
You have installed right all of you. Yes,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4475-1
01:50:21.978 --> 01:50:27.693
here it show more options for sure and
here is open with the code.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4485-0
01:50:29.253 --> 01:50:33.543
Got it. All of you online.

level?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4516-0
01:50:35.373 --> 01:50:40.703
Um, excuse me. Um, excuse me. Uh,
I'm using Mac, so I'm not. Uh,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4492-0
01:50:38.653 --> 01:50:39.013
Yes.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4516-1
01:50:40.703 --> 01:50:46.853
so I cannot find the option inside my uh
inside my inside my folder. Yeah.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4524-0
01:50:44.813 --> 01:50:49.541
OK, OK, no no problem.
You will go to this day one and you have

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4524-1
01:50:49.541 --> 01:50:52.053
this option open interminal right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4531-0
01:50:52.653 --> 01:50:58.613
Open in terminal also no.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4573-0
01:50:59.493 --> 01:51:03.288
No fine.
So what you will do is you will copy this

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4536-0
01:50:59.933 --> 01:51:00.293
Yeah.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4573-1
01:51:03.288 --> 01:51:09.316
path where is where you are control C for
those who are using the Mac right only

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4547-0
01:51:03.573 --> 01:51:03.973
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4573-2
01:51:09.316 --> 01:51:14.004
for those D and you will paste it the
path where you are fine.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4573-3
01:51:14.004 --> 01:51:15.493
So you like here CD.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4579-0
01:51:15.853 --> 01:51:19.093
And you can paste that part.
You are inside that one, OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4581-0
01:51:19.813 --> 01:51:20.853
All right. OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4604-0
01:51:22.013 --> 01:51:28.452
And then you will write here code,
code and period and you can open it.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4604-1
01:51:28.452 --> 01:51:34.533
It will open in VS code fine.
So for Mac one you can open this way.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4609-0
01:51:36.213 --> 01:51:39.293
Oh, OK, let me try that real quick.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4606-0
01:51:36.613 --> 01:51:36.773
Right.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4652-0
01:51:43.453 --> 01:51:49.269
And for you guys or all of you can do the
similar way. OK, let me just show you CLS.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4652-1
01:51:49.269 --> 01:51:54.332
Let me show you how you will do.
You have created for example this folder

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4652-2
01:51:54.332 --> 01:51:59.053
here right in D drive or whatever drive.
This is day one all of you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4675-0
01:51:59.053 --> 01:52:02.110
So this is your path.
You can copy the path, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4675-1
01:52:02.110 --> 01:52:05.578
You have copied the path.
You don't have to copy the path.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4675-2
01:52:05.578 --> 01:52:09.458
You will copy from here.
Here control C you have copied the path,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4675-3
01:52:09.458 --> 01:52:09.693
yes.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4694-0
01:52:11.573 --> 01:52:16.184
And then you will go to the command
prompt and which drive you are.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4694-1
01:52:16.184 --> 01:52:20.321
You are in C drive,
so you'll write C If you are in D drive,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4694-2
01:52:20.321 --> 01:52:21.813
you'll write DD colon.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4720-0
01:52:29.653 --> 01:52:36.314
We will open the command prompt OK and if
you are in the C drive and the your

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4720-1
01:52:36.314 --> 01:52:40.413
folder is your folder is in which drive D
or C.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4763-0
01:52:41.373 --> 01:52:45.077
D If it is in D, so you have to write.
If it is in C,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4763-1
01:52:45.077 --> 01:52:50.153
so you'll write the C Otherwise,
if it is in D, you'll write the D colon.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4763-2
01:52:50.153 --> 01:52:54.887
Fine. Whatever drive you have,
you'll write that one. If you have C,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4763-3
01:52:54.887 --> 01:52:56.053
so write C colon.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4782-0
01:52:56.413 --> 01:53:03.781
And then you will write CD and you can
paste that one control C and you can

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4782-1
01:53:03.781 --> 01:53:10.083
paste this one here paste.
So you are here OK and you will write

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4782-2
01:53:10.083 --> 01:53:11.053
here code.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4785-0
01:53:11.453 --> 01:53:13.813
I'm period you can.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4791-0
01:53:15.133 --> 01:53:17.613
Try to this one and you can open directly.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4815-0
01:53:19.253 --> 01:53:29.038
Let me check one by one quickly. No, no.
OK, this is what I have. I get this.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4815-1
01:53:29.038 --> 01:53:33.053
I you have given to the folders.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4830-0
01:53:35.173 --> 01:53:42.030
So I have to get a hold of it.
It will be it works. It's fine.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4830-1
01:53:42.030 --> 01:53:48.453
I'll change it,
but really you will do those for location.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4832-0
01:53:49.533 --> 01:53:50.693
I'm so sorry.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4852-0
01:53:52.133 --> 01:53:59.239
This is adding it to the folder.
So that's when we need that, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4852-1
01:53:59.239 --> 01:54:05.213
Once we'll see that, once we'll see it.
Yes, you have to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4862-0
01:54:09.373 --> 01:54:17.173
Oh, thanks.
So I have to create a new folder.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4863-0
01:54:20.293 --> 01:54:20.373
Why?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4864-0
01:54:24.533 --> 01:54:24.733
Hello.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4865-0
01:54:25.973 --> 01:54:26.093
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4866-0
01:54:28.333 --> 01:54:28.613
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4868-0
01:54:30.693 --> 01:54:31.613
Right.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4869-0
01:54:35.653 --> 01:54:40.293
OK, 30 minutes.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4872-0
01:54:48.173 --> 01:54:51.053
So yes.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4882-0
01:54:58.173 --> 01:55:10.293

What is?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4889-0
01:55:31.813 --> 01:55:48.093
Yeah, it's.

01:55:48.573 --> 01:55:58.801
Then all of you.
Then after that you'll let code.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4899-1
01:55:58.801 --> 01:56:02.893
So what should I do?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/4900-0

01:58:45.533 --> 01:58:50.893
Now it goes to all these get started with
VS code, so I've used all the.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5032-0
01:58:52.733 --> 01:58:57.810
Sorry, there's a option next which huh?
See there is there is one more thing.

01:58:57.810 --> 01:59:01.715
If you don't want to do this way,
I will show you one more.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5032-2
01:59:01.715 --> 01:59:03.733
Just here we will open VS code.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5062-0
01:59:05.813 --> 01:59:12.928
OK you will open the VS code from here
fine and then you will go here file open

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5062-1
01:59:12.928 --> 01:59:19.865

01:59:41.996 --> 01:59:43.893
Let me write here first.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5103-0
01:59:45.733 --> 01:59:47.573
FIRST first dot.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5116-0
01:59:49.693 --> 01:59:55.416
Py. This extension is for Python.
I have read first dot py.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5116-1
01:59:55.416 --> 01:59:58.373
Done all of you online as well.

02:00:00.853 --> 02:00:06.373
Then we will write here print and we will
write here welcome to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5131-0
02:00:11.293 --> 02:00:12.853
Welcome to Python.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5178-0
02:00:15.733 --> 02:00:21.579
Fine this first line we have read so it
is going to print this message.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5178-1
02:00:21.579 --> 02:00:28.075
This is the P dot py is the extension
like you have the extension right dot TXT

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5178-2
02:00:28.075 --> 02:00:32.542
dot CS and all.
Similarly we have the extension dot py

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5178-3
02:00:32.542 --> 02:00:34.653
for Python we have raised.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5181-0
02:00:35.053 --> 02:00:38.373
First dot py so welcome to Python.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5229-0
02:00:42.173 --> 02:00:48.492
I repeat, I repeat. See here delete.
I'm repeating what we have done.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5229-1
02:00:48.492 --> 02:00:55.172
You you have opened this folder.
Here you have the option new file right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5229-2
02:00:55.172 --> 02:01:01.853
All of you here you have rate.
Let me call it first FIFIRST first dot PY.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5236-0
02:01:01.933 --> 02:01:07.773
Fine and here is we have right here print.

02:01:10.853 --> 02:01:15.173
And here we are right. Welcome to Python.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5244-0
02:01:17.973 --> 02:01:18.133
Right.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5283-0
02:01:21.213 --> 02:01:26.779
Done. No, no problem. You'll do it. Yes,

02:01:26.779 --> 02:01:30.834
One more time. I'm repeating.
See here all of you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5283-2
02:01:30.834 --> 02:01:35.844
I'm repeating one more time.
Just if you have done the school.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5283-3
02:01:35.844 --> 02:01:40.933
If you're not done, no issue.
We'll open the VS code from here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5321-0
02:01:41.133 --> 02:01:47.585
I am telling you from here you will go
here file open folder right here is open

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5321-1
02:01:47.585 --> 02:01:52.504
folder and you will go to the location
where you want to do.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5321-2
02:01:52.504 --> 02:01:58.391
So we have created in data D AIML and day
one I have select that folder.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5321-3
02:01:58.391 --> 02:02:01.053
We have opened this folder right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5353-0
02:02:01.173 --> 02:02:05.062
Then up to this level.
Now after this you will go here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5353-1
02:02:05.062 --> 02:02:10.270
Once you will take the mouse here you
will find out these option new file.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5353-2
02:02:10.270 --> 02:02:15.548
OK you will click on this new file and
here you can write the name of file.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5353-3
02:02:15.548 --> 02:02:17.493
I have given the name first.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5363-0
02:02:17.533 --> 02:02:23.550
1st and dot and PY.
So this is the first Python file I have

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5363-1
02:02:23.550 --> 02:02:24.653
right done.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5380-0
02:02:27.213 --> 02:02:29.823
No problem.
If you want to ask me 30 times,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5380-1
02:02:29.823 --> 02:02:32.909
I have no issue at all,
but you must do the things.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5380-2
02:02:32.909 --> 02:02:34.333
Now we have right print.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5441-0
02:02:35.853 --> 02:02:40.328
Print this print and we have right here
welcome to Python.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5441-1
02:02:40.328 --> 02:02:44.272
This one line I want to show you how we
will write.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5441-2
02:02:44.272 --> 02:02:50.491
So see in any programming language what
we will write we will write the code that

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5441-3
02:02:50.491 --> 02:02:55.573
code is compiled and then it will convert
to the machine readable.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5470-0
02:02:55.693 --> 02:03:01.310
Format and then machine read out those
instruction and give you the result.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5470-1
02:03:01.310 --> 02:03:07.075
So we have right here we have asked the
Python to give the message welcome to

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5470-2
02:03:07.075 --> 02:03:10.623
Python.
We have read it print welcome to Python

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5470-3
02:03:10.623 --> 02:03:12.693
right done up to this level.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5471-0
02:03:14.133 --> 02:03:14.213
So.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5476-0
02:03:16.613 --> 02:03:19.933
You can write online also you have done
guys.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5478-0
02:03:26.133 --> 02:03:26.853
All of you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5509-0
02:03:28.173 --> 02:03:34.470
Now you will go here,
view terminal and in the terminal I

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5509-1
02:03:34.470 --> 02:03:41.744
repeat, you will go here,
view and the first one. We will go here,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5509-2
02:03:41.744 --> 02:03:44.133
view here is terminal.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5519-0
02:03:45.533 --> 02:03:52.133
The second last from last second last we
will light here. We will light here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5527-0
02:03:56.333 --> 02:03:59.813
Python and we will write first dot py.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5546-0
02:04:03.693 --> 02:04:06.822
Fine,
you will write Python and then you will

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5546-1
02:04:06.822 --> 02:04:11.312
write your file name first dot pyth.
So it will print that thing.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5546-2
02:04:11.312 --> 02:04:13.013
Welcome to Python, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5561-0
02:04:16.773 --> 02:04:23.510
OK.
We will take a break now and after this

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5561-1
02:04:23.510 --> 02:04:31.013
break we will. Yes. OK. I'm, I'm, I'm,
I'm, I'm.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5566-0
02:04:31.373 --> 02:04:42.733
Yeah, yeah. What is it doing today?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5567-0
02:04:47.893 --> 02:04:48.613
Everything.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5572-0
02:04:50.773 --> 02:04:56.653
Oh, sorry. Oh, uh.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5574-0

OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5596-0
02:05:35.973 --> 02:05:45.733
See all of you. One more thing,
you will go here 5.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5645-0
02:05:47.293 --> 02:05:51.202
File and this is auto save.
You have to select this one other way you

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5645-1
02:05:51.202 --> 02:05:54.330
have to save every time.
We'll click on this auto save.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5645-2
02:05:54.330 --> 02:05:58.128
It will be by default it is like this one.
We'll click on this one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5645-3
02:05:58.128 --> 02:06:01.479
It should be checked.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5653-1
02:06:08.056 --> 02:06:08.653

OK, I was.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5757-0
02:08:36.173 --> 02:08:53.613
Yes, that's true.
That's why I start guessing.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5760-0
02:08:54.173 --> 02:09:13.333
That's good. I don't know. I don't know.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5764-0
02:09:19.333 --> 02:09:31.493
OK, fine.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5772-0

02:09:56.453 --> 02:09:58.253
OK, you need that.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5774-0
02:10:09.333 --> 02:10:13.333
Yeah, yeah.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5785-0
02:10:19.293 --> 02:10:34.373
Yeah, yeah.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5789-0

Exactly, yeah.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5797-0
02:10:52.893 --> 02:11:05.778
I don't understand. It's my understanding.
OK, yeah, we can have that.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5797-1
02:11:05.778 --> 02:11:12.493
We can have that point about loading.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5799-0
02:11:15.493 --> 02:11:30.733
We can.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5812-0
02:12:06.293 --> 02:12:16.693
In all of the.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5818-0
02:12:47.093 --> 02:12:51.693
You're not.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5821-0
02:13:08.493 --> 02:13:10.253
Yeah.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5827-0
02:13:11.133 --> 02:13:30.533
Yeah, that's.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5828-0
02:13:30.893 --> 02:13:37.253
That's it.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5833-0
02:13:53.453 --> 02:14:08.373
And I think.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5834-0
02:14:10.293 --> 02:14:25.013
Yeah, but.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5843-0
02:14:46.093 --> 02:14:50.733
But the main.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5845-0
02:15:10.053 --> 02:15:10.533
In my.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5847-0
02:15:18.653 --> 02:15:18.773
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5849-0
02:15:21.973 --> 02:15:30.053
Yeah, yeah.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5853-0
02:15:48.893 --> 02:15:52.733
We can.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5854-0
02:15:54.133 --> 02:15:54.293
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5861-0
02:16:38.133 --> 02:16:47.093
We have to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5862-0
02:16:47.133 --> 02:16:48.293
That's correct.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5865-0
02:16:56.413 --> 02:16:59.813
Yeah, yeah, I don't think.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5868-0
02:17:14.853 --> 02:17:15.453
I'm just.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5870-0
02:17:27.533 --> 02:17:29.013
You have to then buy me.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5874-0
02:17:30.173 --> 02:17:48.613
OK, thank you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5875-0
02:17:48.973 --> 02:18:04.853
This is going to be the help show. OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5886-0
02:18:05.773 --> 02:18:19.505
If you don't want this,
most of the program you have do that the

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5886-1
02:18:19.505 --> 02:18:20.773
board.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5898-0
02:18:41.413 --> 02:18:53.333
OK, I'll get you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5899-0
02:18:55.293 --> 02:19:13.693
You know, it wasn't actually.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5900-0
02:19:14.133 --> 02:19:22.733
It's something, but I, I, I.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5904-0
02:19:33.653 --> 02:19:47.173
I'll get you. I'll get you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5905-0
02:19:47.453 --> 02:19:50.573
I like that.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5916-0
02:19:51.853 --> 02:20:08.533
I think it's basically who I want to
discuss in the paper. I think it's fine.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5917-0
02:20:11.333 --> 02:20:17.973
It's VP.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5933-0
02:20:19.293 --> 02:20:36.013
Uh, which we need to. I think it's.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5938-0
02:20:38.093 --> 02:20:57.533
I can't. I can't.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5939-0
02:20:57.973 --> 02:21:04.773
OK, I'll do it.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5946-0
02:21:30.253 --> 02:21:45.293
But you don't really follow up 159,
that's something I'm not.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5947-0
02:21:50.133 --> 02:21:58.973
I think.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5948-0
02:22:02.293 --> 02:22:07.693
It's going to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5955-0
02:22:25.413 --> 02:22:34.933
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5968-0
02:22:35.413 --> 02:22:43.653
I don't think.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5979-0
02:22:50.973 --> 02:23:06.504
About, I could do that big enough online,
but don't even want the office.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/5979-1
02:23:06.504 --> 02:23:09.653
So I just need.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6000-0
02:23:10.333 --> 02:23:14.858
Uh,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6000-1
02:23:14.858 --> 02:23:22.903
said and then they had ahead of you. OK,
I must guess me up. Lisa, but I'm not.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6000-2
02:23:22.903 --> 02:23:28.133
I'm just like to be on the pool.
The items will be.

02:23:28.493 --> 02:23:47.973
I think, uh, I think last minute.
So now we'll be moving. So I do not.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6045-0
02:23:54.573 --> 02:23:59.229

02:35:55.893 --> 02:35:59.213
Oh, OK, OK,
so so I got the left panel now.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6763-0
02:35:59.733 --> 02:36:03.982
You go to the left panel now. Fine.
You you will open the four.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6747-0
02:36:01.933 --> 02:36:03.333
I OK, yeah.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6763-1
02:36:03.982 --> 02:36:07.036
You will go here.
You can install the Python.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6763-2
02:36:07.036 --> 02:36:09.493
You have installed the Python, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6762-0
02:36:10.173 --> 02:36:10.573
Ahead.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6775-0
02:36:11.733 --> 02:36:16.493
OK, here here is extension.
You will write here Python.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6770-0
02:36:12.173 --> 02:36:13.493
So I got done.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6777-0
02:36:18.173 --> 02:36:19.173

Then now you will go here after
installation.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6839-1
02:36:39.814 --> 02:36:47.249
Once the installation is done you will
open this folder file open folder and

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6839-2
02:36:47.249 --> 02:36:52.173
this day one select folder you have open
it right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6845-0
02:36:52.173 --> 02:36:55.013
It is first we already have created.
Let's create the second one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6852-0
02:36:58.453 --> 02:37:00.893
New file I have created second.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6851-0
02:37:00.893 --> 02:37:01.213
Yes.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6854-0
02:37:03.013 --> 02:37:03.853
Second dot py.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6855-0
02:37:08.773 --> 02:37:08.973
Right.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6857-0
02:37:17.733 --> 02:37:19.093
2nd.5.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6867-0
02:37:32.893 --> 02:37:40.093
You have the C type charger.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6872-0
02:37:42.533 --> 02:37:43.253
Thank you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6873-0
02:37:53.733 --> 02:37:53.893
No.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6905-0
02:37:54.733 --> 02:38:02.599
Here see we have the theory I will tell
you first we will write here for example

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6905-1
02:38:02.599 --> 02:38:09.299
username. This is a variable.
We have declared username is equal to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6905-2
02:38:09.299 --> 02:38:12.213
We have rates some value here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6906-0
02:38:13.853 --> 02:38:14.613
It is.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6910-0
02:38:15.893 --> 02:38:18.293
Sam 1256.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6920-0
02:38:19.933 --> 02:38:22.876
Fine,
we have right to this one and we have

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6920-1
02:38:22.876 --> 02:38:24.013
right here print.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6922-0
02:38:30.173 --> 02:38:31.733
Welcome to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6924-0
02:38:33.493 --> 02:38:34.213
Python.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6938-0
02:38:36.453 --> 02:38:40.616
And then we want to add that username as
well.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6938-1
02:38:40.616 --> 02:38:43.893
So we have right here comma username.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6947-0
02:38:47.413 --> 02:38:50.813
So this time we want to welcome this
particular user.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6949-0
02:38:53.253 --> 02:38:54.133
Do it.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6999-0
02:38:55.613 --> 02:39:01.524
Then I will start discussing the theory a
bit and we will start writing the code.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6999-1
02:39:01.524 --> 02:39:06.642
Just just print how to print.
I'm showing you if you have something to

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6999-2
02:39:06.642 --> 02:39:09.598
print.
We have right here the this is an

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6999-3
02:39:09.598 --> 02:39:12.842
variable.
Variable is a place in the memory.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/6999-4
02:39:12.842 --> 02:39:15.293
We have given the name. This is a.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7038-0
02:39:15.653 --> 02:39:21.428
Here the variable name is username.
Inside this variable we have stored the

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7038-1
02:39:21.428 --> 02:39:25.531
value 71256.
Variable is a kind of container you have

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7038-2
02:39:25.531 --> 02:39:29.330
in memory.
Then memory location we have given the

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7038-3
02:39:29.330 --> 02:39:34.573
name to that container and inside that
container we have stored the.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7076-0
02:39:34.773 --> 02:39:39.806
SAM 1256 you can store anything.
Now what we have done we have right here

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7076-1
02:39:39.806 --> 02:39:45.383
welcome to Python and then we have write
that container name that is username and

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7076-2
02:39:45.383 --> 02:39:50.689
then we have display it will go to that
container and whatever inside it will

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7076-3
02:39:50.689 --> 02:39:51.573
display here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7086-0
02:39:51.933 --> 02:39:55.784
Right,
so it will show you welcome to Python Sam

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7086-1
02:39:55.784 --> 02:39:58.693
1256. It will show you like this, OK?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7095-0
02:40:00.173 --> 02:40:04.681
You will like this one,
then we will discuss a bit theory about

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7095-1
02:40:04.681 --> 02:40:05.033
this.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7098-0
02:40:05.933 --> 02:40:08.213
Oh, and we will continue.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7099-0
02:40:10.613 --> 02:40:11.093
Done.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7116-0
02:40:14.653 --> 02:40:20.286
Now to run it what you have to write we
will go to the terminal and we will write

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7116-1
02:40:20.286 --> 02:40:20.973
the python

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7122-0
02:40:23.133 --> 02:40:26.573
And then we will write our file name.
What is our file name?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7125-0
02:40:28.933 --> 02:40:30.053
Second dot py.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7129-0
02:40:32.693 --> 02:40:35.813
View and terminal.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7176-0
02:40:41.613 --> 02:40:47.003
Then we'll write Python second dot py.
So welcome to Python 7125 in the first

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7176-1
02:40:47.003 --> 02:40:51.841
dot first one we have right.
If you run first dot py what we have run

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7176-2
02:40:51.841 --> 02:40:57.093
we have write welcome to Python only.
This one we have write with username.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7200-0
02:40:57.453 --> 02:41:00.809
So the first is first dot py welcome to
Python,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7200-1
02:41:00.809 --> 02:41:06.124
second dot py is welcome to Python and
the username right after go to view,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7200-2
02:41:06.124 --> 02:41:07.453
go to the and then.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7239-0
02:41:08.973 --> 02:41:14.816
After view go to the terminal you have
click on the terminal view terminal.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7239-1
02:41:14.816 --> 02:41:20.889
So this terminal will open right like
this one right here you write Python and

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7239-2
02:41:20.889 --> 02:41:24.733
you will write your file name that is
second dot.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7241-0
02:41:24.813 --> 02:41:27.493
Y and then press enter.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7242-0
02:41:29.573 --> 02:41:30.053
Done.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7243-0
02:41:32.413 --> 02:41:32.813
Yeah.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7244-0
02:41:34.933 --> 02:41:35.013
PY.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7245-0
02:41:38.133 --> 02:41:38.373
E.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7262-0
02:41:40.013 --> 02:41:43.007
Whatever the file name,
this is the file name.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7262-1
02:41:43.007 --> 02:41:47.213
Whatever you have name given the same you
have right here dot PY.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7270-0
02:41:55.853 --> 02:41:59.933
You have to forget. I've been OK.
I have a good fight then.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7280-0
02:42:04.093 --> 02:42:16.693
That's fine. No, no problem. OK, sure.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7283-0
02:42:20.133 --> 02:42:23.853
I think that's OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7295-0
02:42:27.533 --> 02:42:32.693
We will go to the.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7309-0
02:42:38.013 --> 02:42:46.891
I think this is already open.
You want to open the tag. You go to file.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7309-1
02:42:46.891 --> 02:42:52.933
File open. OK, sure. So I do here. OK, OK,
open.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7319-0
02:42:52.973 --> 02:43:08.573
That's fine. Now do you? Yeah.
This is for.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7334-0
02:43:09.853 --> 02:43:14.690
This one right?
It's it is new even though here the I

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7334-1
02:43:14.690 --> 02:43:18.453
have given the next second dot one second.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7347-0
02:43:19.853 --> 02:43:26.180
I can. I must start from the welcome.
Welcome to Michael for the first one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7347-1
02:43:26.180 --> 02:43:27.013
Thank you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7356-0
02:43:28.493 --> 02:43:31.653
And here is.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7360-0
02:43:35.413 --> 02:43:36.773
We would like to use her name.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7364-0
02:43:42.893 --> 02:43:44.493
This part we will need.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7367-0
02:43:52.693 --> 02:43:52.933
Yes.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7368-0
02:43:56.493 --> 02:44:00.493
People don't work like.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7376-0
02:44:09.453 --> 02:44:13.053
Be there after that.
This is how wonderful.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7388-0
02:44:14.613 --> 02:44:30.533
OK, it's like, yeah, it's like.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7396-0
02:44:31.133 --> 02:44:43.373
Yeah, we should. What about you?
Anyone like what? OK, right.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7398-0
02:44:45.013 --> 02:44:45.253
So.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7427-0
02:44:51.653 --> 02:44:55.176
Done all of you.
We we are on same page right now.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7427-1
02:44:55.176 --> 02:45:00.218
See this one I have showed you just at
least you get to know what is it.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7427-2
02:45:00.218 --> 02:45:05.813
Let's discuss a bit theory and then we
will continue the practical stuff, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7432-0
02:45:07.053 --> 02:45:12.573
Just to done. What's your name?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7439-0
02:45:15.213 --> 02:45:19.493
You you will go to the view terminal.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7452-0
02:45:21.293 --> 02:45:27.128
View terminal and in this terminal you
will write this Python second dot py and

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7452-1
02:45:27.128 --> 02:45:27.493
fill.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7480-0
02:45:37.333 --> 02:45:44.647
OK, I just. OK, now see,
let me tell you what we have done a bit

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7480-1
02:45:44.647 --> 02:45:51.173
theory and then we will continue just to
minimize it, OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7482-0
02:45:52.853 --> 02:45:53.173
Fine.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7519-0
02:47:24.413 --> 02:47:27.071
See, uh,
this is the end book I will share with

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7519-1
02:47:27.071 --> 02:47:30.893
you as well. You can go through this one,
right? So this the Python.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7520-0
02:47:33.733 --> 02:47:33.893
2.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7559-0
02:47:44.493 --> 02:47:50.877
I will share in WhatsApp group or I will
share on WhatsApp group and other roles.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7559-1
02:47:50.877 --> 02:47:56.093
So what is Python? Someone ask you? Fine.
We already have started,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7559-2
02:47:56.093 --> 02:48:01.933
but you should know what is it. Fine.
So Python is a programming language.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7587-0
02:48:02.853 --> 02:48:07.748
It's very simple,
readable and easy to use language.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7587-1
02:48:07.748 --> 02:48:13.751
So if you are beginner means you are
going to start the program.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7587-2
02:48:13.751 --> 02:48:19.293
It is a perfect language to learn because
see you all know.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7595-0
02:48:19.453 --> 02:48:25.053
Computers is understand only one language
and that language is.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7633-0
02:48:26.013 --> 02:48:33.372
Binary binary means zero and one what you
are saying so zero and one binary bit.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7633-1
02:48:33.372 --> 02:48:40.913
Your machine is understand only zero and
one the the internally your hardware that

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7633-2
02:48:40.913 --> 02:48:45.093
communicate through the this binary
language.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7671-0
02:48:45.613 --> 02:48:49.623
But we are human. We have our languages.
So for example,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7671-1
02:48:49.623 --> 02:48:54.267
we have this English language,
so we will communicate through the

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7671-2
02:48:54.267 --> 02:48:57.855
English.
If you have some other language like your

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7671-3
02:48:57.855 --> 02:49:02.288
own language, right?
Or you have Arabic or any other language,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7671-4
02:49:02.288 --> 02:49:05.173
so you communicate through that language.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7672-0
02:49:05.973 --> 02:49:06.533
So.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7712-0
02:49:08.013 --> 02:49:11.070
Computers communicate through the zero
and one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7712-1
02:49:11.070 --> 02:49:16.038
So we have we human want to interact with
the computer. So what we have done,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7712-2
02:49:16.038 --> 02:49:20.879
we have created higher level language
that is known as high level language.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7712-3
02:49:20.879 --> 02:49:24.573
These languages that we can communicate
with for example.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7755-0
02:49:25.213 --> 02:49:29.886
We have right in the Python key print
welcome to Python.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7755-1
02:49:29.886 --> 02:49:36.281
So we want to give the instruction to the
computer to please print welcome to

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7755-2
02:49:36.281 --> 02:49:40.790
Python, right?
So we can't say it directly in English.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7755-3
02:49:40.790 --> 02:49:45.053
So what we will do,
we will write in a programming.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7798-0
02:49:45.053 --> 02:49:48.671
Language.
That language have its own compiler.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7798-1
02:49:48.671 --> 02:49:52.750
It will compile it and convert it to the
byte codes.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7798-2
02:49:52.750 --> 02:49:56.676
That codes are these that computer can
understand.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7798-3
02:49:56.676 --> 02:50:02.526
So there is a layer that we will write
the code in the language that we can

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7798-4
02:50:02.526 --> 02:50:03.373
understand.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7821-0
02:50:03.453 --> 02:50:09.461
And then that language is converted to
the zero and one that computer can

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7821-1
02:50:09.461 --> 02:50:13.846
understand. Fine.
So the Python is a simple language.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7821-2
02:50:13.846 --> 02:50:19.773
Here we can write our things and we can
send it to the computers, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7822-0
02:50:19.893 --> 02:50:20.293
So.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7877-0
02:50:28.333 --> 02:50:33.297
There is a lot of things that you need to
understand once you will start learning a

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7877-1
02:50:33.297 --> 02:50:36.134
language.
The installation we have done like we

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7877-2
02:50:36.134 --> 02:50:40.507
will write the instruction in the
language that instruction computer will

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7877-3
02:50:40.507 --> 02:50:43.935
follow. That is the program.
So just like you use Arabic,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7877-4
02:50:43.935 --> 02:50:48.013
Hindi or English to communicate with each
other, we use programming.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7910-0
02:50:48.013 --> 02:50:54.109
Language like Python, C, C, Java,
VB and other languages to communicate

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7910-1
02:50:54.109 --> 02:50:59.105
with the computer.
So programming is a way to instruct the

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7910-2
02:50:59.105 --> 02:51:06.133
computer to perform various tasks. Clear.
So programming is a way. It is a method.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7962-0
02:51:06.253 --> 02:51:10.237
To instruct the computer that do the
various tasks for us, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7962-1
02:51:10.237 --> 02:51:13.919
So computer will understand the
instruction in zero and one,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7962-2
02:51:13.919 --> 02:51:17.541
but we will write the instruction in
higher level language.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7962-3
02:51:17.541 --> 02:51:22.310
That instruction after compilation will
convert to the computer understandable

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7962-4
02:51:22.310 --> 02:51:22.853
language.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7972-0
02:51:23.293 --> 02:51:27.097
Right. For example,
we have a translator in between that is

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/7972-1
02:51:27.097 --> 02:51:29.253
translating the things to you, so.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8013-0
02:51:30.813 --> 02:51:34.614
The benefit of using the Python one is
easy to understand.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8013-1
02:51:34.614 --> 02:51:38.030
It is very easy to understand,
free and open source.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8013-2
02:51:38.030 --> 02:51:42.153
It is freely available.
You need not to give any money for this

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8013-3
02:51:42.153 --> 02:51:44.795
one.
For example you have downloaded and

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8013-4
02:51:44.795 --> 02:51:47.373
install it. There is no charge involved.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8057-0
02:51:47.453 --> 02:51:52.503
The second one is this is high level
language and we can write it in the Linux,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8057-1
02:51:52.503 --> 02:51:56.670
we can write in Mac OS,
we can write in Windows operating system,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8057-2
02:51:56.670 --> 02:52:00.710
in any operating system.
You can see here also he is using Mac,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8057-3
02:52:00.710 --> 02:52:05.698
you are using Windows, so it's portable.
His code you can use on your machine,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8057-4
02:52:05.698 --> 02:52:07.213
your code he can use in.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8096-0
02:52:07.413 --> 02:52:13.534
His machine as well and it is easy and
you will enjoy working with this one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8096-1
02:52:13.534 --> 02:52:20.372
So installation that we already have done.
We will go to the python.org. It's python.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8096-2
02:52:20.372 --> 02:52:23.790
org.
We can download and install it to our

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8096-3
02:52:23.790 --> 02:52:26.573
machines that we already have done.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8129-0
02:52:27.253 --> 02:52:33.508
Now we will write the simple Python code.
We can write print and inside that we can

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8129-1
02:52:33.508 --> 02:52:37.679
write in double quotes whatever we want
to print right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8129-2
02:52:37.679 --> 02:52:42.668
And to store it to save it,
we will write the file name dot PY the

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8129-3
02:52:42.668 --> 02:52:43.413
file name.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8168-0
02:52:44.013 --> 02:52:48.741
Could be anything.
For example we have user first dotpy one

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8168-1
02:52:48.741 --> 02:52:53.941
file we have created the second one we
have created second dotpy.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8168-2
02:52:53.941 --> 02:52:59.772
So this PY is the extension like you have
work with word Ms. word. So Ms.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8168-3
02:52:59.772 --> 02:53:02.373
word have the extension dot DOCX.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8199-0
02:53:02.853 --> 02:53:05.907
Nowadays it DOCX.
Earlier it was DOC right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8199-1
02:53:05.907 --> 02:53:09.725
Nowadays it's DOCX.
So you are creating the PowerPoint

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8199-2
02:53:09.725 --> 02:53:13.056
presentation.
They have the extension dot PPTX.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8199-3
02:53:13.056 --> 02:53:17.013
You are using Excel.
They have the extension dot excels.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8245-0
02:53:17.613 --> 02:53:20.746
XLS.
So similarly this Python have the

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8245-1
02:53:20.746 --> 02:53:25.887
exchanger dot PY. Got it?
So that's why we write after the file

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8245-2
02:53:25.887 --> 02:53:29.662
name we write PY.
File name could be anything.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8245-3
02:53:29.662 --> 02:53:35.848
For example we have created the first dot
PY, we have created second dot PI.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8245-4
02:53:35.848 --> 02:53:37.053
You can create.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8284-0
02:53:37.293 --> 02:53:41.522
Example one dot py.
You can use the welcome dot py.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8284-1
02:53:41.522 --> 02:53:45.262
Anything you can use right?
Clear that point.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8284-2
02:53:45.262 --> 02:53:48.841
The next thing is there is package
manager.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8284-3
02:53:48.841 --> 02:53:53.801
We have N number of packages here that we
have not done yet.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8284-4
02:53:53.801 --> 02:53:56.973
I'm going to show you after this right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8323-0
02:53:56.973 --> 02:54:01.939
We have a number of packages that we can
use in programming. For example,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8323-1
02:54:01.939 --> 02:54:05.899
you want you want to use the code that is
already written.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8323-2
02:54:05.899 --> 02:54:11.000
You don't want to use the code, you want.
You don't want to write the code,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8323-3
02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:14.893
but you want to use the code that already
there. So what?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8372-0
02:54:15.093 --> 02:54:20.978
We have we have here is a command pip PIP
so package we are going to install.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8372-1
02:54:20.978 --> 02:54:26.410
We write the package install and the
package name that you are going to

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8372-2
02:54:26.410 --> 02:54:30.258
install so we can install it and there is
modules.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8372-3
02:54:30.258 --> 02:54:34.333
We can create the code and we will put
inside a file.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8413-0
02:54:34.893 --> 02:54:40.751
And that code we can use in our other
program also that is known as modules.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8413-1
02:54:40.751 --> 02:54:46.533
So we can create here multiple modules.
So module is a file containing code

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8413-2
02:54:46.533 --> 02:54:52.315
returned by someone else or returned by
you as well. That's not a big deal,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8413-3
02:54:52.315 --> 02:54:54.293
but it is returned by all.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8440-0
02:54:54.573 --> 02:54:58.104
Already return code that we want to add
into our project.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8440-1
02:54:58.104 --> 02:55:00.905
So once we want to add it,
we will import it.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8440-2
02:55:00.905 --> 02:55:04.924
We will import and use it.
I will show you how we will import and

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8440-3
02:55:04.924 --> 02:55:06.933
use the already return code also.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8454-0
02:55:08.053 --> 02:55:11.947
So here are two types of modules in
Python.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8454-1
02:55:11.947 --> 02:55:15.133
One is built-in and one is external.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8484-0
02:55:17.733 --> 02:55:21.487
Fine,
we can use the built-in modules or we can

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8484-1
02:55:21.487 --> 02:55:26.415
use the external modules.
Let me show you one example of. Yes,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8491-0
02:55:23.173 --> 02:55:30.974
Sir, Sir, sorry.
Can you share again the slide because the

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8484-2
02:55:26.415 --> 02:55:28.293
please. Yes, yes please.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8491-1
02:55:30.974 --> 02:55:32.693
slide is off?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8513-0
02:55:34.293 --> 02:55:40.533
You you are not able to see the slides.
Oh, sorry. Yeah, sorry, sorry, sorry.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8496-0
02:55:35.773 --> 02:55:36.773
Yeah.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8513-1
02:55:40.533 --> 02:55:46.453
Actually, I have not shared the screen.
I'm extremely sorry for this one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8510-0
02:55:42.373 --> 02:55:43.973
Thank you, Sir.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8513-2
02:55:46.453 --> 02:55:48.133
Let me just go again.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8561-0
02:55:52.973 --> 02:55:59.266
Sorry you you should ask me earlier.
So we have done what is programming right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8561-1
02:55:59.266 --> 02:56:05.165
So this one is just like you you this one
we have seen and what is Python.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8561-2
02:56:05.165 --> 02:56:11.379
We have discussed this one feature of
Python installation we have already have

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8561-3
02:56:11.379 --> 02:56:11.773
done.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8578-0
02:56:12.813 --> 02:56:18.213
Right and we have discussed how we will
create the print thing.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8578-1
02:56:18.213 --> 02:56:23.613
So we have seen print welcome to the
username and thanks a lot.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8609-0
02:56:31.573 --> 02:56:37.140
We have seen how to will how we will
print a particular thing.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8609-1
02:56:37.140 --> 02:56:44.033
So we have displayed here welcome to
Python and once we will create a file we

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8609-2
02:56:44.033 --> 02:56:46.773
will give the extension dot PY.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8616-0
02:56:47.133 --> 02:56:52.893
Just to ensure that this is a Python 5,
right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8626-0
02:56:55.733 --> 02:57:00.973
Now if you want to install some extra
module, so we will go for uh.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8628-0
02:57:02.493 --> 02:57:03.893
This one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8678-0
02:57:19.773 --> 02:57:23.106
We will go to PIP.
This is package manager.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8678-1
02:57:23.106 --> 02:57:29.243
We install using this one PIP and we will
like the install and we'll install the

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8678-2
02:57:29.243 --> 02:57:34.017
extra packages right and we have few
built in modules as well.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8678-3
02:57:34.017 --> 02:57:39.093
If you want to use those code we can
import it and put inside our.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8707-0
02:57:39.533 --> 02:57:45.257
Program, right? So that's the modules.
So we have two types of modules here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8707-1
02:57:45.257 --> 02:57:51.130
One is built-in modules that's already
returned. You can install and use them.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8707-2
02:57:51.130 --> 02:57:54.253
Second one is you can write your own code.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8739-0
02:57:54.853 --> 02:57:59.299
Or you can use the PIP and you can
install them right.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8739-1
02:57:59.299 --> 02:58:03.422
So we have a number of modules like we
have flask,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8739-2
02:58:03.422 --> 02:58:09.647
we have other modules that we can use.
Now I'm going to show you how we will

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8739-3
02:58:09.647 --> 02:58:10.213
create.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8746-0
02:58:11.893 --> 02:58:15.973
And the programs that uh using the
modules and all right.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8790-0
02:58:18.973 --> 02:58:23.578
And the variables we have seen here,
one example of a string.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8790-1
02:58:23.578 --> 02:58:28.778
We have declared the username and we have
stored inside the username.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8790-2
02:58:28.778 --> 02:58:34.498
We have stored the Sam 1256, right?
So similarly we have the other variables

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8790-3
02:58:34.498 --> 02:58:35.613
we can declare.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8804-0
02:58:36.253 --> 02:58:41.120
We can write the username like we want to
write the username or anything.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8804-1
02:58:41.120 --> 02:58:43.093
So variables once you declare.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8840-0
02:58:45.053 --> 02:58:48.633
Let me show you a few things related to
variables.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8840-1
02:58:48.633 --> 02:58:52.704
So you you are going to declare a
variables. For example,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8840-2
02:58:52.704 --> 02:58:56.985
let me show you here.
I'm going to write here one more file,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8840-3
02:58:56.985 --> 02:58:59.653
new file. Let me call it the variable.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8879-0
02:59:00.773 --> 02:59:06.989
Let me call it card.py, right?
So here is you can declare a variable.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8879-1
02:59:06.989 --> 02:59:13.827
So variable name should should have a
meaningful name that show the intended

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8879-2
02:59:13.827 --> 02:59:19.333
purpose of that one. For example,
we have right here int age.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8926-0
02:59:19.693 --> 02:59:23.802
We have right here age,
so this age is showing that we are going

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8926-1
02:59:23.802 --> 02:59:27.596
to take the age of someone, right?
We have right here name,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8926-2
02:59:27.596 --> 02:59:31.516
so it's going to show you that we are
going to give the name.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8926-3
02:59:31.516 --> 02:59:35.689
You should not use arbitrary like ABCD or
something. For example,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8926-4
02:59:35.689 --> 02:59:39.293
there should not be any invalid character
like you have.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8931-0
02:59:39.293 --> 02:59:40.653
Uh uh, let's you have it user.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8977-0
02:59:43.813 --> 02:59:48.039
And you have already this hash 123,
so that is not allowed.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8977-1
02:59:48.039 --> 02:59:53.321
There should not be any invalid character.
So once you declare a variable,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8977-2
02:59:53.321 --> 02:59:58.604
you should follow these naming convention.
These rules you have to follow.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/8977-3
02:59:58.604 --> 03:00:03.253
Variable name can contain alphabets,
digit and under score. Fine.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9018-0
03:00:03.613 --> 03:00:08.725
The variable name can only start with an
alphabet and under score.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9018-1
03:00:08.725 --> 03:00:12.083
A variable name can not start with a
digit,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9018-2
03:00:12.083 --> 03:00:17.959
means you can't start it 123 and so on.
You can use 123 but at the end or in

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9018-3
03:00:17.959 --> 03:00:23.453
between, but not at the starting.
It should start with the alphabet no.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9059-0
03:00:23.653 --> 03:00:27.345
No white space.
You can write user space name,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9059-1
03:00:27.345 --> 03:00:32.607
so there should not be any white space in
between this one, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9059-2
03:00:32.607 --> 03:00:38.656
We have the type of type of data types
here integer if you want to store the

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9059-3
03:00:38.656 --> 03:00:43.133
complete number,
whole number without the decimal point.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9119-0
03:00:43.533 --> 03:00:48.700
So what we will use, we will use integer.
If you want to use the decimal point,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9119-1
03:00:48.700 --> 03:00:52.639
we will use floating points.
If you want to use the strings,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9119-2
03:00:52.639 --> 03:00:58.000
you will use the strings like we have to
use the username 71256. That is a string.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9119-3
03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:01.681
If you want to use booleans,
boolean is for true, false.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9119-4
03:01:01.681 --> 03:01:02.973
We will use boolean.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9136-0
03:01:03.293 --> 03:01:07.278
If you want to use the none,
so we'll write the none if you don't want

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9136-1
03:01:07.278 --> 03:01:10.253
to give anything. For example,
let me show you here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9166-0
03:01:11.693 --> 03:01:18.347
I have declared here the username.
Username is let's say Sameer. Fine.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9166-1
03:01:18.347 --> 03:01:25.938
This is the username age. This is 13.
This is an integer. This is an age, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9166-2
03:01:25.938 --> 03:01:27.813
We have rate salary.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9182-0
03:01:29.253 --> 03:01:37.130
Salary of let's say 50,000.50.
This is floating point, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9182-1
03:01:37.130 --> 03:01:40.053
And then we have right.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9183-0
03:01:41.573 --> 03:01:41.613
Uh.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9185-0
03:01:43.573 --> 03:01:45.253
Is graduate.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9201-0
03:01:48.893 --> 03:01:55.670
And we have right here false.
So that is boolean value true and false

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9201-1
03:01:55.670 --> 03:01:57.413
and we have right.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9208-0
03:01:59.173 --> 03:02:03.013
No, no. So here is the qualifications.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9209-0
03:02:10.733 --> 03:02:12.533
We'll see.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9214-0
03:02:19.213 --> 03:02:24.173
Please have house quality.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9217-0
03:02:28.053 --> 03:02:30.373
Is stay status.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9243-0
03:02:35.133 --> 03:02:39.247
We have written none,
so we don't know about this one. None.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9243-1
03:02:39.247 --> 03:02:43.767
None means there is nothing.
It's blank kind of thing that is not.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9243-2
03:02:43.767 --> 03:02:47.341
So we have this thing.
Now you want to display fine,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9243-3
03:02:47.341 --> 03:02:48.893
so you can write print.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9245-0
03:02:51.973 --> 03:02:52.933
You can write here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9248-0
03:02:56.853 --> 03:02:57.253
Username.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9255-0
03:03:00.093 --> 03:03:01.853
And here is username.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9256-0
03:03:04.933 --> 03:03:05.013
Age.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9257-0
03:03:05.093 --> 03:03:05.173
Age.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9297-0
03:03:07.813 --> 03:03:13.035
Age. Let me write in double quotes.
Do you need to have a space in the

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9297-1
03:03:13.035 --> 03:03:16.860
integer for?
See this is the variable name you have

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9297-2
03:03:16.860 --> 03:03:20.611
declare right?
So here it should not be the space.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9297-3
03:03:20.611 --> 03:03:25.613
This is the text that you are writing.
Here you can write anything.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9299-0
03:03:27.333 --> 03:03:28.173
Fine. Uh.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9304-0
03:03:30.173 --> 03:03:31.093
Let me write here given.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9334-0
03:03:33.533 --> 03:03:37.647
User name is. You can write here anything.
That's not an issue.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9334-1
03:03:37.647 --> 03:03:42.082
This is in double quotes.
Double quotes means seven after the print.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9334-2
03:03:42.082 --> 03:03:46.839
We need the space between the print and
the bracket. Parenthesis. No, no,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9334-3
03:03:46.839 --> 03:03:50.053
it's not required. OK,
you can write it this way.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9356-0
03:03:50.733 --> 03:03:55.081
close, right. Oh, spaces. Yes, yes.
You allow or don't allow?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9356-1
03:03:55.081 --> 03:04:00.973
Only not not space. No space, no spaces.
No space. That means not allow, right? It.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9390-0
03:04:03.533 --> 03:04:08.121
I will not give you the issue if you like
this way also that's fine,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9390-1
03:04:08.121 --> 03:04:12.842
but it's generally we don't write.
Both are correct. Both are correct,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9390-2
03:04:12.842 --> 03:04:17.830
but generally we like this way. OK,
it's not an issue, it's fine. Both OK,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9390-3
03:04:17.830 --> 03:04:19.293
both OK, I will write.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9399-0
03:04:19.293 --> 03:04:24.779
But that was by mistake.
I have right there, but that is OK. Yeah,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9399-1
03:04:24.779 --> 03:04:26.253
so here is salary.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9402-0
03:04:30.173 --> 03:04:32.133
Be right here, salary.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9408-0
03:04:33.933 --> 03:04:37.533
Then we have right here print.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9410-0
03:04:41.493 --> 03:04:42.293
Redo it.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9414-0
03:04:43.853 --> 03:04:48.413
Very late. Sorry, he's graduate.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9418-0
03:04:51.653 --> 03:04:53.973
And here we have red.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9419-0
03:04:58.533 --> 03:04:59.333
Still.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9421-0
03:05:04.053 --> 03:05:04.773
Status.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9422-0
03:05:10.413 --> 03:05:10.653
Mm.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9477-0
03:05:11.933 --> 03:05:15.467
This test status all of you you can do
with this one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9477-1
03:05:15.467 --> 03:05:20.376
This is we have right here the few
variables though variables can how many

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9477-2
03:05:20.376 --> 03:05:25.089
types of variable is possible.
After that I will take these values from

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9477-3
03:05:25.089 --> 03:05:28.493
the user.
This user will input and we will display.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9477-4
03:05:28.493 --> 03:05:31.373
Right now I have showed you the hard
coded.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9484-0
03:05:31.533 --> 03:05:35.405
The later on we want to take this data
from the user, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9484-1
03:05:35.405 --> 03:05:37.373
So first you'll like this much.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9543-0
03:05:41.733 --> 03:05:45.950
OK this this is the basic one.
We have declared all the data types we

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9543-1
03:05:45.950 --> 03:05:50.288
have here. The first one is a string,
second one is for integer for the

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9543-2
03:05:50.288 --> 03:05:53.842
complete number,
whole number if you want to take and then

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9543-3
03:05:53.842 --> 03:05:58.301
the salary that is for floating point
when decimal numbers if you want is

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9543-4
03:05:58.301 --> 03:06:01.253
graduate.
This is a boolean number boolean have.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9546-0
03:06:01.453 --> 03:06:04.693
Two types of values. One is false,
the second one is.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9583-0
03:06:07.053 --> 03:06:11.420
Second one is true. Yes.
So Boolean have two types of values,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9583-1
03:06:11.420 --> 03:06:15.294
one is true, one is false.
Just and this state status.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9583-2
03:06:15.294 --> 03:06:18.604
This is the none.
None means we don't want to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9583-3
03:06:18.604 --> 03:06:23.253
We don't have the idea about that.
So this one is the example of.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9626-0
03:06:24.253 --> 03:06:28.291
Integer integer.
So you want to comment this thing.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9626-1
03:06:28.291 --> 03:06:34.426
So you select this one and you press
control KC. So this is comment out right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9626-2
03:06:34.426 --> 03:06:40.328
So for example I want to write this one.
This is the integer example right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9626-3
03:06:40.328 --> 03:06:42.813
So I write here integer example.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9630-0
03:06:43.013 --> 03:06:46.133
So if you want to write the comment,
you can write here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9634-0
03:06:46.973 --> 03:06:50.413
Hash. So what is it? This one is.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9680-0
03:06:51.453 --> 03:06:54.776
This one is actually tell that this is a
comment.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9680-1
03:06:54.776 --> 03:06:59.428
The compiler will not read out this one.
This is just for the for the

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9680-2
03:06:59.428 --> 03:07:03.083
understanding that what we are doing over
here, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9680-3
03:07:03.083 --> 03:07:08.134
Similarly here this this one you won't
write. This is integer example here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9680-4
03:07:08.134 --> 03:07:08.533
Sorry.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9701-0
03:07:10.253 --> 03:07:15.680
Related this is integer example.
So this is integer example and this one

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9701-1
03:07:15.680 --> 03:07:19.621
is what example for what? The first one?
Any of you?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9701-2
03:07:19.621 --> 03:07:23.413
This is a string example right?
And the third one?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9725-0
03:07:24.573 --> 03:07:32.447
Oh, what's your name? This is floating,
right? Floating number good.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9725-1
03:07:32.447 --> 03:07:40.093
And this one is. This is Boolean, right?
Boolean. And this one is.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9756-0
03:07:40.253 --> 03:07:45.423
None, right? This is none data type.
So these are the data types we have and

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9756-1
03:07:45.423 --> 03:07:48.847
we are displaying here.
This is the first example.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9756-2
03:07:48.847 --> 03:07:52.674
Later on we will take these things from
the user, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9756-3
03:07:52.674 --> 03:07:55.293

That's all.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9922-0
03:13:17.733 --> 03:13:22.133

03:14:11.453 --> 03:14:16.351
In if it is a string,
you have to put in the double quotes.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9960-1
03:14:16.351 --> 03:14:19.453
Did you write this this double quotes?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/9962-0
03:14:23.973 --> 03:14:24.573

we can just, we can just.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10012-0
03:15:59.853 --> 03:16:03.853
No, yes. If it is open, you can write.
If it is close, you can be again.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10023-0
03:16:06.893 --> 03:16:10.362
Because I close, no, that's fine.
If you I'm not close,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10023-1
03:16:10.362 --> 03:16:11.973
you can use directly also.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10027-0

OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10032-0
03:16:53.573 --> 03:16:57.333
OK, done, done.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10034-0
03:17:00.853 --> 03:17:01.573
But.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10035-0
03:17:06.773 --> 03:17:08.533
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10049-0
03:17:35.293 --> 03:17:53.973
Yeah, it's OK.

I think we can. You know what you think?
People say. I've lost. I'm getting. Hello.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10070-1

I'll make something. Your mic is going to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10078-0
03:18:49.773 --> 03:18:51.893
They should.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10081-0
03:19:05.373 --> 03:19:06.333
I'm.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10106-0
03:19:09.013 --> 03:19:23.653
Oh, I didn't. OK,
the first one is not actually. I I also.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10116-0
03:19:25.893 --> 03:19:38.133
I mean, I mean, you think it will save.
I mean, it's not.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10155-0
03:19:39.613 --> 03:19:43.535
Whenever you like anything,
it's sort of like, I said, well,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10155-1
03:19:43.535 --> 03:19:47.008
you have to stay a bit,
you have to write everything.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10155-2
03:19:47.008 --> 03:19:51.509
So I have to go to the file and boot it
all to save, right? Yes, yes,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10155-3
03:19:51.509 --> 03:19:54.981
this one you do.
I know you need not to do any short.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10155-4
03:19:54.981 --> 03:19:56.653
So the second one is that.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10183-0
03:19:56.973 --> 03:20:00.785
Yeah, everything is working.
We can check the second one or two and

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10183-1
03:20:00.785 --> 03:20:03.531
the first one also the same thing, right?
Right.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10183-2
03:20:03.531 --> 03:20:07.623
The first one is one more point
everything. OK, sure. No, it's not sure.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10183-3
03:20:07.623 --> 03:20:10.426
OK, so we go, we we jump to the third one,
right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10183-4
03:20:10.426 --> 03:20:13.173
Because this one is in touch screen.
So it's OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10210-0
03:20:13.453 --> 03:20:19.953
Thanks for the OK now next one,

ask.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10210-2
03:20:24.131 --> 03:20:29.053
We are going to create one more we want
to take the.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10212-0
03:20:29.573 --> 03:20:31.453
Input from the user.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10240-0
03:20:32.533 --> 03:20:38.314
Fine, what do we want to do?
We want to take the input from the user.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10240-1
03:20:38.314 --> 03:20:42.196
So here we go.
I'm going to create a new file.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10240-2
03:20:42.196 --> 03:20:47.813
Final name is taking input.
I have given the name this time taking.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10267-0
03:20:48.373 --> 03:20:52.835
Input. You can give any name.
Just because we are writing the first,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10267-1
03:20:52.835 --> 03:20:56.457
second, third,
you might think that it should be first,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10267-2
03:20:56.457 --> 03:21:00.467

So I am writing taking input dot py right

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10267-3
03:21:00.467 --> 03:21:01.373

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10269-0
03:21:04.613 --> 03:21:06.373
Now I write here.

You'll go to the terminal.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10316-1
03:21:56.403 --> 03:21:59.173

03:22:49.493 --> 03:22:56.010
Back slash T means we want a space,
a tab space, a space of tab tab.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10382-1
03:22:56.010 --> 03:23:02.811
You know the tab, the tab space we want.
You are right. Enter username.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10382-2
03:23:02.811 --> 03:23:08.573
Here you are right tab.
So you'll see here. Let me show you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10409-0
03:23:08.653 --> 03:23:14.422
CLS clear screen you have run it.
I will run Python and the file name is

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10409-1
03:23:14.422 --> 03:23:18.215
taking input.py right?
So here is the username.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10409-2
03:23:18.215 --> 03:23:23.747
You have read the username that is Sameer
for example. So welcome Mr.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10409-3
03:23:23.747 --> 03:23:24.933
or Miss Sameer.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10411-0
03:23:25.573 --> 03:23:26.693
Is that it?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10413-0
03:23:28.453 --> 03:23:30.293
Do it all of you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10416-0
03:23:35.693 --> 03:23:43.413
Oh, we can't.
We can't and because certainly is not.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10417-0
03:23:44.853 --> 03:23:45.173
Thank you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10429-0
03:23:46.413 --> 03:23:50.316
Yeah, I have to get a book.
You have to find rules,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10429-1
03:23:50.316 --> 03:23:51.893
but they're going to.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10466-0
03:23:53.213 --> 03:23:56.991
It's back slash tab hot tab test space
here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10466-1
03:23:56.991 --> 03:24:03.456
See if you have rated without this one
without back slash T let me show you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10466-2
03:24:03.456 --> 03:24:08.074
So if you have rated this one without you
have run it.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10466-3
03:24:08.074 --> 03:24:11.013
So enter username it's coming here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10492-0
03:24:12.013 --> 03:24:18.827
Sameer and it's coming here without the
space. You want the space after this,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10492-1
03:24:18.827 --> 03:24:24.768
so you write back slash T and once you've
done that under username,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10492-2
03:24:24.768 --> 03:24:26.253
let's here Sandy.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10495-0
03:24:27.053 --> 03:24:28.413
Where is it?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10543-0
03:24:32.213 --> 03:24:36.043
So what do we have done?
We have created one more file,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10543-1
03:24:36.043 --> 03:24:41.514
file name we have given taking input.
So then I have to create file right right

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10543-2
03:24:41.514 --> 03:24:47.122
So by taking input right taking input dot
file and we have taken the username and

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10543-3
03:24:47.122 --> 03:24:50.405
we have.
This is the simplest string if we have

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10543-4
03:24:50.405 --> 03:24:51.773
any other data type.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10549-0
03:24:51.893 --> 03:24:55.530
Other than its string. So what?
How we will do it right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10549-1
03:24:55.530 --> 03:24:57.253
So first we'll do this one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10572-0
03:25:02.133 --> 03:25:10.125
Now you guys connected with this by now
you will start enjoying because in

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10572-1
03:25:10.125 --> 03:25:16.413
starting it happen but later on it it
will be on this one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10593-0
03:25:18.173 --> 03:25:21.200
So don't worry,
I will teach you from the scratch.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10593-1
03:25:21.200 --> 03:25:24.524
If you don't know anything about
computers or anything,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10593-2
03:25:24.524 --> 03:25:27.373
Inchala will learn Inchana about it.
Thank you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10594-0
03:25:28.333 --> 03:25:28.453
Yes.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10629-0
03:25:35.133 --> 03:25:39.510
This this one these two slash.
See here this is escape sequence.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10629-1
03:25:39.510 --> 03:25:43.416
I will show you.
See here you have run this taking input.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10629-2
03:25:43.416 --> 03:25:47.052
You have write the username.
Any name you have write.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10629-3
03:25:47.052 --> 03:25:49.813
Let's say you have write this soha right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10667-0
03:25:50.413 --> 03:25:55.055
Here is Mr. or miss.
If you want to show one single slash we

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10667-1
03:25:55.055 --> 03:26:00.610
have to write the two slashes.
If you write one here you write one so it

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10667-2
03:26:00.610 --> 03:26:04.643
is it become a string.
It will not become the slash.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10667-3
03:26:04.643 --> 03:26:09.133
So this this one if you want to write you
have to write 2.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10670-0
03:26:10.373 --> 03:26:13.493
To show one, you have to write 2.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10695-0
03:26:14.373 --> 03:26:19.358
Here we want to put one slash,
so we have to write 2 slashes to show so

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10695-1
03:26:19.358 --> 03:26:25.174
that the the the the slash will be on the
right slash instead of left slash, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10695-2
03:26:25.174 --> 03:26:26.213
Right this one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10715-0
03:26:27.453 --> 03:26:32.387
I the binder.
Your one is just like I'm just they might

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10715-1
03:26:32.387 --> 03:26:38.115
error. So it's giving it.
I will checks to go back two by two by

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10715-2
03:26:38.115 --> 03:26:39.613
two slash, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10721-0
03:26:40.413 --> 03:26:46.293
Uh, this one is welcome. Mr.
Ron's is the tab space.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10722-0
03:26:52.613 --> 03:26:53.253
Thanks.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10737-0
03:26:56.213 --> 03:27:07.173
OK, yeah, we just go on.
I think we're waiting.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10738-0
03:27:12.533 --> 03:27:22.693
We have.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10739-0
03:27:29.333 --> 03:27:31.093
Do you?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10746-0
03:27:49.373 --> 03:27:52.053
I love you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10753-0
03:27:53.493 --> 03:28:08.213
I think we should.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10755-0
03:28:10.813 --> 03:28:11.333
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10765-0
03:28:20.173 --> 03:28:22.373
I will be.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10766-0
03:28:30.653 --> 03:28:31.253
You stop.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10767-0
03:28:32.653 --> 03:28:35.093
We saw that in the.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10770-0
03:28:52.253 --> 03:28:58.453
But then one, then we have the same thing.
Thank you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10774-0
03:29:14.693 --> 03:29:14.853
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10778-0

03:30:00.133 --> 03:30:01.173
Oh.

Yeah.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10828-0
03:31:47.333 --> 03:31:51.093
It's possibly.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10834-0
03:32:02.293 --> 03:32:02.573
OK.

03:35:10.533 --> 03:35:11.253
Six.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10911-0
03:35:18.253 --> 03:35:20.453
Check the screen.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10929-0
03:35:22.613 --> 03:35:35.200
This is because the version is we're
using the version instead of.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10929-1
03:35:35.200 --> 03:35:39.333
I'll just restart the.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10949-0
03:35:39.773 --> 03:35:45.619
This, this docs,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10949-1
03:35:45.619 --> 03:35:51.997
It's the bottom line,
bottom line on the video.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10949-2
03:35:51.997 --> 03:35:59.173

03:36:04.453 --> 03:36:14.239
Yeah, we can find from this.
We can get hold of this.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10959-1
03:36:14.239 --> 03:36:19.133
I think you have to remove.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10967-0
03:36:19.453 --> 03:36:33.306
So here you guys need to.
It's a fresh spreading problem.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10967-1
03:36:33.306 --> 03:36:36.173
It's common.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10971-0
03:36:50.373 --> 03:36:52.013
Well.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10992-0
03:36:53.373 --> 03:37:00.507
This phone site you mean the the echo and
talk to the machine. OK,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10992-1
03:37:00.507 --> 03:37:06.470
temperature you can create.
You can create the default,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10992-2
03:37:06.470 --> 03:37:08.493
so you can make it.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10996-0
03:37:08.573 --> 03:37:16.049
It's the same here, correct? No,
it's usually it's one word.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10996-1
03:37:16.049 --> 03:37:23.893
You can use whatever it is.
You must be comfortable, right? OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/10999-0
03:37:24.293 --> 03:37:27.013
What is going on?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11009-0
03:37:27.973 --> 03:37:47.773
It will work after.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11013-0
03:37:47.853 --> 03:37:52.413
Let's see here. OK, this one is done.
All of you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11020-0
03:38:36.933 --> 03:38:50.213
Yeah, I think that.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11046-0
03:38:50.613 --> 03:38:55.620
OK, now you have done this.
This one is this thing right? Yes.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11046-1
03:38:55.620 --> 03:39:00.627
Now you want to use for example here the
age you want to take.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11046-2
03:39:00.627 --> 03:39:02.773
So you have right here age.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11080-0
03:39:07.333 --> 03:39:11.869
Is equal to. You are right.
I'm showing you the wrong thing.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11080-1
03:39:11.869 --> 03:39:15.736
Then I will correct it.
So here is enter age. Fine.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11080-2
03:39:15.736 --> 03:39:20.792
So you have right enter the age,
but age is integer you want right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11080-3
03:39:20.792 --> 03:39:24.213
So what do you have to do?
You are right int.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11082-0
03:39:26.773 --> 03:39:28.093
And you will.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11091-0
03:39:31.493 --> 03:39:34.733
Do this one so it will convert to the
integer.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11104-0
03:39:37.893 --> 03:39:44.204
Int input enter age.
Then we can take the integer right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11104-1
03:39:44.204 --> 03:39:46.973
So enter age. So here is.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11112-0
03:39:51.293 --> 03:39:55.413
After this I'm printing both I think.
Welcome Mr.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11113-0
03:39:57.013 --> 03:39:57.493
Drink.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11118-0
03:40:01.893 --> 03:40:05.533
Your age is I have right here age.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11160-0
03:40:07.573 --> 03:40:11.488
OK,
so means when we put that and then you

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11160-1
03:40:11.488 --> 03:40:18.043
send this our name, right? OK.
And then take each of ours and then your

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11160-2
03:40:18.043 --> 03:40:25.054
page is the number of our gates. Yes,
I see. Not not to copy everything. No,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11160-3
03:40:25.054 --> 03:40:26.693
you can write any.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11165-0
03:40:27.053 --> 03:40:31.493
I think you can write here name,
let's say name, for example this one name.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11201-0
03:40:34.093 --> 03:40:39.483
We write anything name in this one.
The username here is enter username here

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11201-1
03:40:39.483 --> 03:40:44.523
the age. So what we have done,
we have run it again Python taking input

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11201-2
03:40:44.523 --> 03:40:48.513
enter username.
Let's say I have read Sam the age I have

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11201-3
03:40:48.513 --> 03:40:49.773
read let's say 35.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11206-0
03:40:50.733 --> 03:40:54.053
So here is the name is this one and age
is 35.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11243-0
03:40:55.613 --> 03:41:00.502
Now the benefit of using this one,
for example name you have read something

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11243-1
03:41:00.502 --> 03:41:05.713
and here in age you have read this one.
So it will give you the invalid internal

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11243-2
03:41:05.713 --> 03:41:10.603
input with the base type because it will
take only the number for this one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11243-3
03:41:10.603 --> 03:41:12.533
It will not accept the string.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11245-0
03:41:12.893 --> 03:41:13.733
Got it.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11247-0
03:41:15.093 --> 03:41:16.493
I repeat.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11290-0
03:41:22.973 --> 03:41:26.197
The second one is for the numbers,
the integer.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11290-1
03:41:26.197 --> 03:41:30.631
Integer means it will take only the
numbers, right? Not anything.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11290-2
03:41:30.631 --> 03:41:34.259
So here is you can run it again.
Python taking input.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11290-3
03:41:34.259 --> 03:41:38.626
You write the username,
let's say we have write Ali and here the

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11290-4
03:41:38.626 --> 03:41:40.373
age we have write here 25.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11295-0
03:41:40.893 --> 03:41:45.573
So here the name early age is 25, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11318-0
03:41:59.973 --> 03:42:05.451
So we can. We can.
We can keep manually down here, right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11318-1
03:42:05.451 --> 03:42:11.213
Yes, yes, yes, yes. If it is closed, no.
So we'll go. Sorry.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11349-0
03:42:13.573 --> 03:42:18.321
View terminal will open.
So whatever name you will write it will

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11349-1
03:42:18.321 --> 03:42:24.165
take that thing like input then you type
it manually open right right you write

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11349-2
03:42:24.165 --> 03:42:27.891
manually.
For example you have right here and here

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11349-3
03:42:27.891 --> 03:42:29.133
the age is 19 OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11351-0
03:42:29.133 --> 03:42:31.173
I see.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11383-0
03:42:34.893 --> 03:42:39.391
Salman, yes please.
Can you show again how to write the

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11355-0
03:42:34.933 --> 03:42:35.933
It's Salman.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11371-0
03:42:36.893 --> 03:42:40.413
Can you show again how to write the
integer?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11383-1
03:42:39.391 --> 03:42:44.933
integer? How to write the integer right?
See here we have write age.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11378-0
03:42:42.693 --> 03:42:43.093
Yes.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11385-0
03:42:46.493 --> 03:42:48.213
Let me just show you again.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11435-0
03:42:49.373 --> 03:42:54.780
We have declare your username input enter
username age. We have write int.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11435-1
03:42:54.780 --> 03:42:58.384
We want to convert it to integer input
enter age.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11435-2
03:42:58.384 --> 03:43:03.431
We have read print name and username.
Here is the print your age age.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11435-3
03:43:03.431 --> 03:43:08.117
Now you want to run it.
You will go here Python taking input dot

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11435-4
03:43:08.117 --> 03:43:08.333
PY.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11457-0
03:43:08.333 --> 03:43:14.700
You write the username,
let's say here is Sudhir and here the age

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11457-1
03:43:14.700 --> 03:43:21.453
you are right, let's say 30.
So here the name Sudhir age is 30. Fine.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11463-0
03:43:24.613 --> 03:43:26.573
Is it OK now?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11461-0
03:43:26.133 --> 03:43:26.253
OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11464-0
03:43:27.853 --> 03:43:28.693
OK, OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11465-0
03:43:29.413 --> 03:43:30.213
Do it.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11497-0
03:44:28.413 --> 03:44:34.013
What else I have told you?
What are the data types I told you in the

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11497-1
03:44:34.013 --> 03:44:37.908
third?
In the third one I told you the integer,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11497-2
03:44:37.908 --> 03:44:42.453
then floating point for the boolean these
things right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11511-0
03:44:43.453 --> 03:44:48.244
You can check others as well. For example,
you want to take the salary,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11511-1
03:44:48.244 --> 03:44:50.773
so I will take you a late year salary.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11517-0
03:44:52.253 --> 03:44:57.293
Is equal to done this one. OK,
we are right here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11523-0
03:45:00.173 --> 03:45:03.733
Plot via radial input.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11527-0
03:45:06.173 --> 03:45:07.773
Enter salary.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11529-0
03:45:09.653 --> 03:45:11.533
Fine here print.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11531-0
03:45:16.933 --> 03:45:17.293
Salary.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11532-0
03:45:18.973 --> 03:45:19.133
Yes.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11536-0
03:45:21.333 --> 03:45:23.373
We have right here salary.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11542-0
03:45:25.973 --> 03:45:29.173
OK, so you have run it again.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11559-0
03:45:30.853 --> 03:45:39.264
Username term age is let's say 34,
salary is let's say 90,000.90.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11559-1
03:45:39.264 --> 03:45:41.813
So here is this one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11577-0
03:47:19.853 --> 03:47:19.973
Done.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11596-0
03:47:22.653 --> 03:47:28.436
So two data, three data.
We have check here the boolean also fine.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11596-1
03:47:28.436 --> 03:47:32.493
So for example for boolean we have right
here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11598-0
03:47:34.213 --> 03:47:36.053
Uh, let's see.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11602-0
03:47:40.533 --> 03:47:41.933
No database.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11604-0
03:47:47.973 --> 03:47:49.613
Database.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11606-0
03:47:51.253 --> 03:47:51.973
Knowledge.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11614-0
03:48:02.253 --> 03:48:06.293
Database knowledge.
Here we have write boolean.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11616-0
03:48:07.973 --> 03:48:09.893
All input.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11620-0
03:48:16.613 --> 03:48:20.613
Do you know data basis?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11623-0
03:48:25.253 --> 03:48:27.293
Do you know databases?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11652-0
03:48:42.573 --> 03:48:47.693
So do you know databases?
We have asked the question whatever we

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11652-1
03:48:47.693 --> 03:48:53.680
have, we can say true or false, yes or no,
right? So do you know databases?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11652-2
03:48:53.680 --> 03:48:55.413
So here we have print.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11656-0
03:48:56.893 --> 03:49:00.293
Database knowledge.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11659-0
03:49:10.773 --> 03:49:12.133
Hello.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11663-0
03:49:16.493 --> 03:49:18.453
I'll be the glass.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11664-0
03:49:20.893 --> 03:49:21.133
Hmm.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11665-0
03:49:23.053 --> 03:49:23.453
Yeah.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11666-0
03:49:25.253 --> 03:49:26.773
The.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11672-0
03:49:28.853 --> 03:49:36.653
We talk about.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11677-0
03:49:42.693 --> 03:49:45.773
So here is database nodes.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11681-0
03:49:58.333 --> 03:50:01.013
No, the data basis.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11690-0
03:50:02.533 --> 03:50:07.008
Yes or no.
So here is database knowledge we have

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11690-1
03:50:07.008 --> 03:50:08.013
right here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11692-0
03:50:11.773 --> 03:50:12.533
Your database.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11696-0
03:50:15.493 --> 03:50:17.533
Now you will go here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11698-0
03:50:20.213 --> 03:50:21.693
Down up to this level.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11703-0
03:50:26.053 --> 03:50:29.693
We can open the terminal view terminal.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11720-0
03:50:39.453 --> 03:50:46.305
Is it readable now? OK,
we have right here again Python taking

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11720-1
03:50:46.305 --> 03:50:49.133
input username, let's say.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11740-0
03:50:55.413 --> 03:51:03.049
Riya age is let's say 30 and salary is 98,
000.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11740-1
03:51:03.049 --> 03:51:09.253
45 and the database knowledge is false.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11741-0
03:51:13.013 --> 03:51:13.493
Mhm.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11772-0
03:51:31.133 --> 03:51:36.029
If how do I if I want to make it false,
how do I make it false? No,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11772-1
03:51:36.029 --> 03:51:39.701
it's something happening.
It should be false only.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11772-2
03:51:39.701 --> 03:51:44.021
I will check just a second.
Whatever I say will come to me.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11772-3
03:51:44.021 --> 03:51:48.053
Why do I become that that this is stuff
of database KN?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11773-0
03:51:48.413 --> 03:51:48.773
Sorry.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11816-0
03:51:50.893 --> 03:51:55.100
This is this is the name.
You can write anything here.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11816-1
03:51:55.100 --> 03:52:00.379
You can write the new database knowledge.
This is the variable name.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11816-2
03:52:00.379 --> 03:52:04.663
This is the data knowledge KNW.
You have read this one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11816-3
03:52:04.663 --> 03:52:09.253
So this is data knowledge KNW only.
You can write anything.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11841-0
03:52:09.613 --> 03:52:14.826
This is the variable name.
Now enter the name Sam.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11841-1
03:52:14.826 --> 03:52:20.959
Enter the age here the 35 salary.
You have read something .

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11841-2
03:52:20.959 --> 03:52:26.173
34 adult knowledge false which showing 2
to false.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11846-0
03:52:26.253 --> 03:52:29.893
I would be covered. Uh, just a second.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11859-0
03:52:40.893 --> 03:52:46.498
Return is true when the argument is true,
otherwise false. I got it.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11859-1
03:52:46.498 --> 03:52:48.773
See here what we will do is.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11872-0
03:52:50.053 --> 03:52:54.042
Uh,
let me show you how it will show you the

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11872-1
03:52:54.042 --> 03:52:58.653
phone and control minus will go your view
terminal.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11895-0
03:53:00.293 --> 03:53:07.101
Here is Python.
Here is enter name Sam under age 34,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11895-1
03:53:07.101 --> 03:53:13.653
salary 98,000.90. Here it do you know?
Just enter.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11929-0
03:53:15.933 --> 03:53:20.292
Fine. OK, you will not write anything.
If you write anything it will take. Oh,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11929-1
03:53:20.292 --> 03:53:24.596
if you don't put anything it becomes true.
If you write anything it will true

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11929-2
03:53:24.596 --> 03:53:27.852
otherwise false.
Let me show you Python taking input file.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11929-3
03:53:27.852 --> 03:53:31.053
We have write the same right?
We have read age something.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11958-0
03:53:31.733 --> 03:53:36.049
Let's say something 45 and here in the
salary we have read 67.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11958-1
03:53:36.049 --> 03:53:39.338
Do you know database?
I enter so this is false.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11958-2
03:53:39.338 --> 03:53:42.970
Since you have not given any input that
means false.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11958-3
03:53:42.970 --> 03:53:46.053
If you have given the input it will be
true.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11961-0
03:53:57.173 --> 03:53:57.413
Yes.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11963-0
03:53:59.293 --> 03:53:59.653
Yeah, please.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11968-0
03:54:01.253 --> 03:54:05.573
Why not? I'm here to help you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11969-0
03:54:10.333 --> 03:54:27.893
Again, for you,
don't you really talking for?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11981-0
03:54:41.733 --> 03:54:59.053
Yeah, it's inside. That's why it's.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11986-0
03:54:59.493 --> 03:55:14.573
I'm not explaining to you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11992-0
03:55:15.693 --> 03:55:20.768
So I'm going to, uh,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/11992-1
03:55:20.768 --> 03:55:22.733

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12016-0
03:55:24.213 --> 03:55:32.947
No, it is. No, it's fine.
This here when when you are this double

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12016-1
03:55:32.947 --> 03:55:40.093
books. Which one?
And you are trying in double books.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12030-0
03:55:40.933 --> 03:55:58.253
So it's called. OK, it's still. I see. Oh,
I didn't fully. I didn't record it.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12033-0
03:55:59.453 --> 03:56:05.053
I see. Yeah. Yeah.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12036-0
03:56:14.173 --> 03:56:19.413
I don't know.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12042-0
03:56:22.853 --> 03:56:30.773
So I have to close this tag. OK, no,
you don't need.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12046-0
03:56:32.613 --> 03:56:36.613
OK, I'm done.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12053-0
03:56:39.053 --> 03:56:43.893
I, I, I, I, I.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12069-0
03:56:50.853 --> 03:56:57.253
Thank you.
Anyone else who have the issue online,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12069-1
03:56:57.253 --> 03:56:59.813
offline, any of you?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12073-0
03:57:01.773 --> 03:57:04.693
Online one, everyone is on the same page.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12090-0
03:57:06.893 --> 03:57:16.893
These guys as well, one thing,
are you able to connect with this one now?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12115-0
03:57:17.773 --> 03:57:24.076
Yes Sir, a little bit is fine.
A little bit is fine means if you you

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12115-1
03:57:24.076 --> 03:57:29.010
just connect somehow only one is string,
that's fine.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12115-2
03:57:29.010 --> 03:57:32.573
Not all so simultaneously or gradually.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12154-0
03:57:33.253 --> 03:57:39.107
We will learn a lot of stuff just if you
are able to connect now because this is

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12154-1
03:57:39.107 --> 03:57:42.359
the first day.
I know since it it's kind of,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12154-2
03:57:42.359 --> 03:57:47.563
it's kind of strange for you.
After that you will be familiar with this

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12154-3
03:57:47.563 --> 03:57:50.093
one, right? And whenever, wherever.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12185-0
03:57:50.533 --> 03:57:55.512
And how many times you feel any short of
issue, you just ask me.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12185-1
03:57:55.512 --> 03:57:59.572
There is no such hesitation, nothing.
Don't feel he.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12185-2
03:57:59.572 --> 03:58:05.165
I'm asking the silly question.
Whatever comes in your mind, you can ask.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12185-3
03:58:05.165 --> 03:58:07.693
Just feel free to ask any of you.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12214-0
03:58:07.813 --> 03:58:12.296
Never agitate.
Whenever you need any sort of help,

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12214-1
03:58:12.296 --> 03:58:16.868
just ask.
I'm here and you will understand each and

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12214-2
03:58:16.868 --> 03:58:23.813
everything. Don't worry. So let's do.
We have done up to the this one boolean.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12232-0
03:58:24.253 --> 03:58:27.348
One more data type I showed you. None.
So none means none.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12232-1
03:58:27.348 --> 03:58:31.493
If you don't want to give anything,
that is none, right? So now let's see. OK.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12233-0
03:58:37.053 --> 03:58:37.173
But.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12254-0
03:58:42.173 --> 03:58:46.912
Let's do something with the data.
You are taking the data and you want to

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12254-1
03:58:46.912 --> 03:58:49.795
do some sort of things with the data,
right?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12254-2
03:58:49.795 --> 03:58:52.613
You want to take two numbers from the
user.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12297-0
03:58:54.373 --> 03:58:59.741
For example you want to comment this one
so we don't want to run this program

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12297-1
03:58:59.741 --> 03:59:03.182
anymore.
Let me control that you want to comment.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12297-2
03:59:03.182 --> 03:59:08.687
So here are three two types of comments,
multi line comments you can write this

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12297-3
03:59:08.687 --> 03:59:11.853
way 123 and inside that you can put this
one.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12311-0
03:59:11.933 --> 03:59:15.327
This whole thing inside this so that is
multi line command.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12311-1
03:59:15.327 --> 03:59:19.173
Another way is you will select this one
and you will press control.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12317-0
03:59:20.733 --> 03:59:24.613
It's one control KC the comment.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12352-0
03:59:26.093 --> 03:59:30.941
I I said like and then it's all gone.
I put that control Z.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12352-1
03:59:30.941 --> 03:59:37.324
Press control Z if it's all gone. No, no,
I already be done. So how do I undo?

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12352-2
03:59:37.324 --> 03:59:42.253
Control Casey. Control. Undo. Oh, undo,
undo, undo. Control.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12375-0
03:59:42.973 --> 03:59:50.602
Control Z so here control control KU
uncomment control KC.

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12375-1
03:59:50.602 --> 04:00:00.042
See for example you have removed
everything so you press control Z so it

2f0a7bf5-ef09-4b9e-bcf7-1f2d589f40b7/12375-2
04:00:00.042 --> 04:00:01.853
will come out.
