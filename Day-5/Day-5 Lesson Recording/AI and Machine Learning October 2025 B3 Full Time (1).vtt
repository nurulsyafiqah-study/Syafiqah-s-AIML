02:22:57.903 --> 02:23:01.980
I have some concern about Python
understanding.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9139-0
02:23:03.820 --> 02:23:07.672
The Python you know, language programming,
language understanding.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9139-1
02:23:07.672 --> 02:23:09.340
So I I want to know actually.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9141-0
02:23:11.180 --> 02:23:11.740

02:23:14.140 --> 02:23:18.343
I want to analyse OK. What what? Why?
I mean what is happening?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9168-1
02:23:18.343 --> 02:23:23.598
How is it going on with the with the
overall training as maybe the Python part?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9168-2
02:23:23.598 --> 02:23:26.620
Because we started with the Python right?
So?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9200-0
02:23:28.700 --> 02:23:34.946
What is? How is your understanding you?
Are you able to connect the dots or it's

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9200-1
02:23:34.946 --> 02:23:40.575
totally blur but I would say myself
personally 60% connected but I think

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9200-2
02:23:40.575 --> 02:23:44.740
because of language barrier and we don't
know how to.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9230-0
02:23:46.340 --> 02:23:54.650

02:23:54.650 --> 02:24:01.897
I'm just I let's speak the truth.
I I I totally. I'm totally zero. OK, OK.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9230-2
02:24:01.897 --> 02:24:04.700

02:24:10.738 --> 02:24:14.216
Yeah,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9265-2
02:24:14.216 --> 02:24:19.780
are also having the same issue.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9265-3
02:24:19.780 --> 02:24:24.340
that it's not from the computer science
background nobody.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9303-0
02:24:24.820 --> 02:24:25.060

So ID we that is what?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9310-1
02:24:27.752 --> 02:24:31.069
How the yeah sequel. Yeah.

02:24:31.069 --> 02:24:33.642
We're not into the very depth. Exactly.
Yes.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9310-3
02:24:33.642 --> 02:24:37.815
You're touching the core of the system,
actually. Yeah. That is the yes,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9310-4
02:24:37.815 --> 02:24:41.875
Python actually the world famous.
Yes to programming language now many

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9310-5
02:24:41.875 --> 02:24:45.020
companies like huge class companies.
They're using it.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9345-0
02:24:45.180 --> 02:24:48.259
Yes,
but of course we're we're not living that

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9345-1
02:24:48.259 --> 02:24:52.322
that level of Python.
We're just starting on the basics, yes.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9345-2
02:24:52.322 --> 02:24:56.713
However, that basic also is, you know,
enough to trouble us. Yeah.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9345-3
02:24:56.713 --> 02:25:00.513
It's not exactly happening. OK. Like,
I wish that I have.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9345-4
02:25:00.513 --> 02:25:04.380
I have spoken to Aishree.
It's not in this direction plus.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9395-0
02:25:04.900 --> 02:25:08.165
I might come.
I would like to come to learn only for

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9395-1
02:25:08.165 --> 02:25:11.800
the lingo that make.
It's like we're learning the ABC, OK,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9395-2
02:25:11.800 --> 02:25:15.436
from the scratch.
So I will understand what is each coding

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9395-3
02:25:15.436 --> 02:25:19.810
OK commands for before in terms to the
city, but OK, on the first day,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9395-4
02:25:19.810 --> 02:25:24.740
I think in my opinion that the piece of
it is that we are in terms to the city.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9422-0
02:25:24.860 --> 02:25:29.180
The cinemas. Yes, I know. Yes,
I know this one. How is that so?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9422-1
02:25:29.180 --> 02:25:33.096
It's like no idea.
But you can only whatever that you can

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9422-2
02:25:33.096 --> 02:25:37.889
pick someone to copy and paste.
And if you feel that you don't keep so

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9422-3
02:25:37.889 --> 02:25:40.994
dumb,
you go to the and we get the idea there

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9422-4
02:25:40.994 --> 02:25:43.020
and then we paste it over the.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9468-0
02:25:43.540 --> 02:25:48.253
The visual code and we compare that which
is right or wrong. That is what I mean.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9468-1
02:25:48.253 --> 02:25:52.449
OK, so I just be frank here. Oh, yeah.
Fantastic. Wonderful. Yeah. That,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9468-2
02:25:52.449 --> 02:25:56.472
that that's how we should be. Yes.
When it when it comes to learning,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9468-3
02:25:56.472 --> 02:26:01.013
I will not compromise as well even why
when I sit down for some learning who I

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9468-4
02:26:01.013 --> 02:26:03.140
I'm a I'm a poor learner from others.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9516-0
02:26:03.500 --> 02:26:06.762
Yeah, my my limitation is I sit down,
learn myself.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9516-1
02:26:06.762 --> 02:26:10.778
I can learn a lot because I have my my
way of learning my time.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9516-2
02:26:10.778 --> 02:26:14.857
I spend my time I 10 times I go back
because I don't understand.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9516-3
02:26:14.857 --> 02:26:18.120
Also like some other the trainer,
maybe do advance.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9516-4
02:26:18.120 --> 02:26:22.512
Maybe you know he has bone skill,
but my skill is not like his skill.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9516-5
02:26:22.512 --> 02:26:23.140
So what I.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9548-0
02:26:23.180 --> 02:26:26.930
I do personally because I'm a poor
learner. I know about myself.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9548-1
02:26:26.930 --> 02:26:30.564
I'm not talking about you guys, OK?
Personally, I'm like that.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9548-2
02:26:30.564 --> 02:26:33.391
So I spend a lot of time.
So to learn something.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9548-3
02:26:33.391 --> 02:26:36.737
For some others it may take maybe five
days. For example,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9548-4
02:26:36.737 --> 02:26:38.180
for me to take one month.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9581-0
02:26:39.220 --> 02:26:43.536
So what I do I was I mean,
I have been a trainer,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9581-1
02:26:43.536 --> 02:26:50.185
but for a long time I I learn in the in
the way that I can train because I I

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9581-2
02:26:50.185 --> 02:26:55.020
think from the the student point of view,
what student?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9611-0
02:26:55.660 --> 02:27:00.094
Question will be what is your good
question when I have a problem like this,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9611-1
02:27:00.094 --> 02:27:03.262
my student also will have a programme
like that right?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9611-2
02:27:03.262 --> 02:27:07.639
So my my lending will go like that.
So I go slowly, slowly I go back again.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9611-3
02:27:07.639 --> 02:27:10.980
I do all these things,
everyone coming back to the topic.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9612-0
02:27:11.780 --> 02:27:11.900
Yeah.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9657-0
02:27:13.340 --> 02:27:18.443
So that that there is a problem of
prerequisite and no prior IT exposure,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9657-1
02:27:18.443 --> 02:27:22.857
that problem is there because some of you
are changing carrier.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9657-2
02:27:22.857 --> 02:27:28.512
Some of you are just touching ID without
doing anything else only directly coming

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9657-3
02:27:28.512 --> 02:27:31.340
to the you know the programming language.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9690-0
02:27:32.340 --> 02:27:35.765
So that that actually this kind of
learning,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9690-1
02:27:35.765 --> 02:27:41.701
if there is a is a prior IT learning that
would really help otherwise like IT

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9690-2
02:27:41.701 --> 02:27:48.018
thinking like what I mean by IT thinking
is like you eventually may start thinking

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9690-3
02:27:48.018 --> 02:27:48.780
I I think.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9708-0
02:27:49.220 --> 02:27:54.632
I mean thinking,
thinking in the problem solving at all.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9708-1
02:27:54.632 --> 02:28:00.900
Like for example like when I when I when
we say for example like.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9718-0
02:28:02.940 --> 02:28:07.660
IT thinking in the sense like doing
things every day we we talk about it.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9751-0
02:28:09.020 --> 02:28:13.554
In the college hall,
like you spend maybe one year from the

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9751-1
02:28:13.554 --> 02:28:18.013
lecturer speaking about IT.
So those things all indirectly

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9751-2
02:28:18.013 --> 02:28:22.624
unconsciously, subconsciously,
will make you think IT. Yeah,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9751-3
02:28:22.624 --> 02:28:24.060
that that actually.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9784-0
02:28:24.580 --> 02:28:27.725
We take time and it will happen slowly,
slowly only.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9784-1
02:28:27.725 --> 02:28:31.820
But now that this class just started,
jump started it, jump started.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9784-2
02:28:31.820 --> 02:28:35.144
And you know what's happening is quite
expected. I had.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9784-3
02:28:35.144 --> 02:28:38.586
I even explained to someone on the day
one what has been.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9784-4
02:28:38.586 --> 02:28:41.020
We have discussed this problem will come.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9806-0
02:28:41.660 --> 02:28:47.766
And it kept so it's an expected problem
and something not unexpected.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9806-1
02:28:47.766 --> 02:28:55.006
So the solution for this is like you said
extra class OK which now you can go with

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9806-2
02:28:55.006 --> 02:28:56.140
Mr Salma, OK?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9826-0
02:28:57.460 --> 02:29:01.561
On Saturday,
if you want so where you guys have to

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9826-1
02:29:01.561 --> 02:29:05.663
make a, you know,
like the the the what we call it

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9826-2
02:29:05.663 --> 02:29:09.604
initiative,
yes initiative difference to ask and

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9826-3
02:29:09.604 --> 02:29:12.580
learn if you don't ask it's not good.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9865-0
02:29:13.980 --> 02:29:18.203
Whatever that you can ask, ask.
Please ask Sir, we don't understand.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9865-1
02:29:18.203 --> 02:29:22.793
There is a point that where trainer and
student will differently meet. OK,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9865-2
02:29:22.793 --> 02:29:27.322
so that that that will settle down slowly
slowly. Only things can happen.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9865-3
02:29:27.322 --> 02:29:30.260
Actually you start from basic for example
like.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9901-0
02:29:31.300 --> 02:29:34.702
A programming language?
Why do you need a programming language?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9901-1
02:29:34.702 --> 02:29:37.997
We start computers.
They understand only programming language

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9901-2
02:29:37.997 --> 02:29:41.931
and because like humans speak general
languages like English and you know

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9901-3
02:29:41.931 --> 02:29:44.535
French and all,
so computers only understand for

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9901-4
02:29:44.535 --> 02:29:47.300
programming languages.
So how to talk to computers?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9945-0
02:29:48.180 --> 02:29:51.186
For a human being should be able to talk
to the computers,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9945-1
02:29:51.186 --> 02:29:53.784
so the only way is the programming
language. Yeah,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9945-2
02:29:53.784 --> 02:29:57.962
you can give instructs controlling the
computer exactly. It's under the computer,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9945-3
02:29:57.962 --> 02:30:00.509
so computers will do following your
instructions.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9945-4
02:30:00.509 --> 02:30:04.331
So the instructions you have to give to
the computer using the programming

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9945-5
02:30:04.331 --> 02:30:06.420
language. Otherwise you won't understand.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9965-0
02:30:07.140 --> 02:30:09.758
Whatever you type and execute will it
work? Doesn't work.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9965-1
02:30:09.758 --> 02:30:12.648
Whatever you type in English language and
execute will it work?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9965-2
02:30:12.648 --> 02:30:15.900
It will not work because there's not the
language computer understands.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/9968-0
02:30:17.380 --> 02:30:18.380
Fortunately, unfortunately.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10005-0
02:30:19.820 --> 02:30:24.917
So Python happened to be one of the
easiest language. You haven't seen Java.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10005-1
02:30:24.917 --> 02:30:30.345
You haven't seen other PHP languages you
haven't seen C language you haven't seen

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10005-2
02:30:30.345 --> 02:30:33.457
V language.
You haven't seen other JavaScript.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10005-3
02:30:33.457 --> 02:30:34.980
This thing, that thing.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10021-0
02:30:35.340 --> 02:30:39.944
Like Ruby and Rains,
so many programming languages are there

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10021-1
02:30:39.944 --> 02:30:44.020
which the syntax is very troublesome.
Java is active.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10031-0
02:30:45.860 --> 02:30:50.660
Python happened to be the easiest
language close to the English language.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10064-0
02:30:52.620 --> 02:30:56.677
Yeah. And then,
but also you also misunderstand you will

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10064-1
02:30:56.677 --> 02:31:02.443
not be using your learning Python, right?
You will not be fighting programmes on

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10064-2
02:31:02.443 --> 02:31:06.145
your life. No, the word is not like that.
Normally,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10064-3
02:31:06.145 --> 02:31:09.420
once you understand the programming,
no flow.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10091-0
02:31:11.060 --> 02:31:14.969
You don't have to write programmes just
now. Now we just go on GPT.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10091-1
02:31:14.969 --> 02:31:18.820
I want the programme to do this.
This the ABCD give the programme.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10091-2
02:31:18.820 --> 02:31:22.730
It will give you in a few seconds,
not in a few seconds less than a

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10091-3
02:31:22.730 --> 02:31:23.420
millisecond.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10131-0
02:31:25.260 --> 02:31:29.281
Programme is there,
but will you understand the programme or

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10131-1
02:31:29.281 --> 02:31:31.984
no?
That knowledge you need and then you

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10131-2
02:31:31.984 --> 02:31:35.214
understand the floor.
Even I'm not a programmer,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10131-3
02:31:35.214 --> 02:31:40.291
but I get programmes from charge PT.
I use them to put into some other pipe,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10131-4
02:31:40.291 --> 02:31:43.060
but the the the code editor like the VS 4.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10167-0
02:31:43.540 --> 02:31:45.949
OK,
I don't know what you're using like in VS

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10167-1
02:31:45.949 --> 02:31:48.411
port,
so put it to the VS port and from here I

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10167-2
02:31:48.411 --> 02:31:50.559
run.
I make sure that the programme will

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10167-3
02:31:50.559 --> 02:31:53.859
connect to the network devices become.
I'm a network engineer,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10167-4
02:31:53.859 --> 02:31:58.050
there are network devices like routers
which is all these kind of firewalls and

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10167-5
02:31:58.050 --> 02:31:58.260
all.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10198-0
02:31:58.660 --> 02:32:03.710
I'm. I'm from that background,
so I make this is my programme that I I

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10198-1
02:32:03.710 --> 02:32:09.045
created here from this VS editor I
arrange connectivity that the programme

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10198-2
02:32:09.045 --> 02:32:13.740
will go and configure the devices.
That's called as a automation.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10227-0
02:32:15.860 --> 02:32:21.199
So if you're thinking why do we need a
programme, this is one of the purposes,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10227-1
02:32:21.199 --> 02:32:25.187
so using the programme normally,
what I do in normal life,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10227-2
02:32:25.187 --> 02:32:30.460
I have to go to the device tenant,
my table, log in and do the configuration.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10254-0
02:32:31.420 --> 02:32:35.618
OK, but now what? What's happening?
The programme I'm writing in the VS code

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10254-1
02:32:35.618 --> 02:32:38.127
here,
this programme is going and configuring

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10254-2
02:32:38.127 --> 02:32:41.399
the devices itself. Yes,
I execute here and it knows how to

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10254-3
02:32:41.399 --> 02:32:44.398
connect, connect,
configure after it will give you the

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10254-4
02:32:44.398 --> 02:32:44.780
result.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10280-0
02:32:46.340 --> 02:32:50.770
Something like that. This, this,
this scripts are programmes.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10280-1
02:32:50.770 --> 02:32:53.914
Actually we can create to do certain
tasks.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10280-2
02:32:53.914 --> 02:32:58.987
There are like thousands and thousands of
various purposes. All right,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10280-3
02:32:58.987 --> 02:33:01.060
so that is a that is the use.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10320-0
02:33:01.500 --> 02:33:05.929
That is a purpose. How we work.
Understanding the flow is important.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10320-1
02:33:05.929 --> 02:33:10.743
So like how we learn English language,
we didn't know any language, right?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10320-2
02:33:10.743 --> 02:33:15.942
So language has its own like, you know,
the parts of speech we call them, right.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10320-3
02:33:15.942 --> 02:33:17.740
Like it has its own grammar.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10350-0
02:33:18.260 --> 02:33:22.810
We learn the grammar, right? Yeah,
we learn verbs. We learn nouns.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10350-1
02:33:22.810 --> 02:33:27.767
We learn the the, the, the adverbs,
pronouns. All these things we learn,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10350-2
02:33:27.767 --> 02:33:32.113
conjunctions, interjections, these,
all parts of speech, right.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10350-3
02:33:32.113 --> 02:33:33.540
English language. So.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10371-0
02:33:33.780 --> 02:33:37.106
Like how you learn the language like
Malay, you have a language,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10371-1
02:33:37.106 --> 02:33:40.177
something like that.
This is the language that if you don't

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10371-2
02:33:40.177 --> 02:33:42.838
learn about it,
you cannot speak in Python with the

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10371-3
02:33:42.838 --> 02:33:44.220
computer. That that's idea.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10382-0
02:33:45.540 --> 02:33:53.020
So you one way take extra classes number
one. Number two you have to start reading.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10399-0
02:33:54.700 --> 02:33:58.741
Watching reading about the language you
have to do it every day.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10399-1
02:33:58.741 --> 02:34:01.540
Then your mind will become IT thinking
mind.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10432-0
02:34:02.900 --> 02:34:09.069
It is one way of reading and watching.
What would you suggest we can we can give

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10432-1
02:34:09.069 --> 02:34:15.163
you a list of what? How you can. Yeah,
I can. We can also give you some ebooks.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10432-2
02:34:15.163 --> 02:34:18.820
Just start reading,
you know from the from the.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10472-0
02:34:19.580 --> 02:34:25.358
Yes, to make it the IT thinking, yeah,
so this is how we can sort out this,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10472-1
02:34:25.358 --> 02:34:29.996
but it is a journey.
It's not something that you can you can

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10472-2
02:34:29.996 --> 02:34:35.242
sort it out in a day or two, no.
It's not a receipt, it's not there.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10472-3
02:34:35.242 --> 02:34:38.740
So you you you need to go through this
space.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10496-0
02:34:39.260 --> 02:34:42.324
If there is suffering, OK,
they they without suffering,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10496-1
02:34:42.324 --> 02:34:45.060
nothing will happen.
You have to work hard. Yeah.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10496-2
02:34:45.060 --> 02:34:48.781
You have every day. You must spend time.
Read about it. Little bit.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10496-3
02:34:48.781 --> 02:34:51.900
At least 15 minutes. 20 minutes.
You have to spend time.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10521-0
02:34:53.580 --> 02:34:57.154
That that is the plan. So Saturday I I,
Mr Salman,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10521-1
02:34:57.154 --> 02:35:02.201
will be able to spend time with you guys.
So let us know you're coming.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10521-2
02:35:02.201 --> 02:35:07.037
How many of you want to come?
Come maybe half day or full days after

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10521-3
02:35:07.037 --> 02:35:08.860
you. That is half day. OK.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10559-0
02:35:11.260 --> 02:35:16.027
Have discussions from the scratch
understandable history of the programme,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10559-1
02:35:16.027 --> 02:35:19.270
languages,
how actually the Python will help here.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10559-2
02:35:19.270 --> 02:35:23.656
OK, why why do we need Python?
What you know other images are there.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10559-3
02:35:23.656 --> 02:35:28.487
So in which fields Python can be used in
artificial intelligence by machine

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10559-4
02:35:28.487 --> 02:35:29.060
learning?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10572-0
02:35:29.180 --> 02:35:32.136
Why?
Why Python learn more about this

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10572-1
02:35:32.136 --> 02:35:35.792
background?
Why all these things you must ask,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10572-2
02:35:35.792 --> 02:35:37.660
interact and understand?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10577-0
02:35:39.460 --> 02:35:41.140
So these are the solutions for this.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10613-0
02:35:44.860 --> 02:35:48.017
Because moving forward, it's not.
It's not, of course,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10613-1
02:35:48.017 --> 02:35:52.381
it's not going to be simple, right?
Things will become complicated. I mean,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10613-2
02:35:52.381 --> 02:35:56.285
you're learning technology, right?
So day one will be some day two,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10613-3
02:35:56.285 --> 02:36:00.017
it will become more complex.
Day three will become more complex,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10613-4
02:36:00.017 --> 02:36:03.060
the complexity will go up that that is
how we learn.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10632-0
02:36:03.980 --> 02:36:08.768
Otherwise, with basics, what can you do?
Nothing 0 the fundamentals, basic,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10632-1
02:36:08.768 --> 02:36:13.620
nothing. Fundamentals are only to start,
but you have to reach the the last.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10646-0
02:36:15.660 --> 02:36:19.707
So in order to you for you to be there,
there is a, you know, struggle.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10646-1
02:36:19.707 --> 02:36:21.900
Is it going to be enough for six weeks?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10668-0
02:36:24.140 --> 02:36:28.584
You see, normally it is five days,
five days, five days,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10668-1
02:36:28.584 --> 02:36:34.197
morning until evening. For five days.
They teach all these things. Yep,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10668-2
02:36:34.197 --> 02:36:37.940
that is for those people who are on the
United.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10681-0
02:36:39.780 --> 02:36:42.653
So we,
we designed this programme for 30 days

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10681-1
02:36:42.653 --> 02:36:46.340
for those people like who are not from
anti background oh.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10711-0
02:36:48.460 --> 02:36:51.798
But all these things actually we start go
fast.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10711-1
02:36:51.798 --> 02:36:56.111
One week programme Minify this programme.
So now we broke it.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10711-2
02:36:56.111 --> 02:37:00.493
We broke it into the small small modules
going slowly, slowly.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10711-3
02:37:00.493 --> 02:37:04.180
You know that is how it became that it is
programme.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10722-0
02:37:06.060 --> 02:37:09.495
It is your banks, universities,
some gaming companies.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10722-1
02:37:09.495 --> 02:37:11.620
These companies are fighters only.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10752-0
02:37:13.580 --> 02:37:17.927
Let us not come back with them because
they are coming from IT background,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10752-1
02:37:17.927 --> 02:37:21.869
so that's different case.
So for you all like a six weeks programme

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10752-2
02:37:21.869 --> 02:37:25.463
should be good enough,
but you're coming from a not now on IT

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10752-3
02:37:25.463 --> 02:37:28.420
background you have to do some extra work
at home.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10755-0
02:37:29.020 --> 02:37:29.900
Go slow a bit.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10789-0
02:37:31.260 --> 02:37:36.140
In the class actually we have to manage
other participants who are coming from

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10789-1
02:37:36.140 --> 02:37:39.846
background, right? They have IT value.
So you can catch up.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10789-2
02:37:39.846 --> 02:37:43.244
You know as much as you can catch up if
30 days. Also.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10789-3
02:37:43.244 --> 02:37:46.580
Let's say you you managed to catch up
only 50% of it.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10823-0
02:37:47.340 --> 02:37:50.271
There are many 50%. Don't worry,
we're still there.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10823-1

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10823-3

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10823-4
02:38:01.037 --> 02:38:03.180
I can arrange with the other trainers.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10857-0
02:38:03.620 --> 02:38:07.337
We have other tenant by Mr Yash.
We have one more tenant.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10857-1
02:38:07.337 --> 02:38:11.695
They're all like experts.
So you can join them. Those classes also.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10857-2
02:38:11.695 --> 02:38:16.118
You see those who want to learn.
There are so many ways you all have

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10857-3
02:38:16.118 --> 02:38:20.220
intention to learn. There's no problem.
We we we can find this.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10878-0
02:38:21.140 --> 02:38:25.090
OK,
so Mr Arman actually will slow down a bit

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10878-1
02:38:25.090 --> 02:38:29.299
now. OK,
so that it fully slow down means others

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10878-2
02:38:29.299 --> 02:38:35.140
also will be bore. So to slow down.
It's also like boring sleeping.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10919-0
02:38:36.860 --> 02:38:41.281
So go in the little bit,
slow down and then Saturday you all want

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10919-1
02:38:41.281 --> 02:38:44.430
to come come back. OK,
then we see what to do.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10919-2
02:38:44.430 --> 02:38:49.521
I think on Saturday it's just to revise
to recap, but on on, on normal day,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10919-3

Yeah that is better.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10943-0
02:38:56.300 --> 02:39:00.532
It's just if you put on Saturday and do
new topics that will be different,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/10943-1
02:39:00.532 --> 02:39:03.749

This is using the Philtre right.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11058-0
02:40:49.260 --> 02:40:55.100

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11080-1
02:41:11.433 --> 02:41:14.260
You want to ask something or you just
mute yourself.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11111-0
02:41:21.340 --> 02:41:25.784

02:41:25.784 --> 02:41:30.229
question as well.
Just raise the hand you have the issue.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11111-2
02:41:30.229 --> 02:41:35.900
You can ask if you are not able to ask
properly that I will help you out.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11116-0
02:41:36.340 --> 02:41:39.340
What do you are asking in that one as
well? Got it.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11126-0
02:41:40.820 --> 02:41:44.607
See here,
here you have asked for example this

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11126-1
02:41:44.607 --> 02:41:46.300
thing. We'll go here.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11166-0
02:41:48.940 --> 02:41:52.902
CLS you were working on this one.
So you see here Philtre,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11166-1
02:41:52.902 --> 02:41:56.797
it's coming in this one because we have
printed directly.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11166-2
02:41:56.797 --> 02:42:01.699
We have not used them to display like the
way we want to display, right.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11166-3
02:42:01.699 --> 02:42:03.580
So this one you want to see.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11190-0
02:42:03.820 --> 02:42:10.320
Why it's coming in the curly braces?
So because we have just Sprint here to do

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11190-1
02:42:10.320 --> 02:42:14.022
it quickly.
So otherwise what we have to do,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11190-2
02:42:14.022 --> 02:42:18.877
what we have to do,
we have to write here 4 or let's say E

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11190-3
02:42:18.877 --> 02:42:19.700
and value.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11191-0
02:42:20.580 --> 02:42:21.020
In.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11195-0
02:42:23.140 --> 02:42:27.180
The student marks dot items.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11211-0
02:42:28.620 --> 02:42:36.049
This is using the dictionaries we have
done right and here is you will like this

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11211-1
02:42:36.049 --> 02:42:37.700
tab enter so here.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11254-0
02:42:40.500 --> 02:42:46.680
KKK is for the key key is name here and
this one is value the first one before

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11254-1
02:42:46.680 --> 02:42:51.375
the column is key,
the second one after the column is value

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11254-2
02:42:51.375 --> 02:42:54.739
right?
So here what you are saying is that

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11254-3
02:42:54.739 --> 02:43:00.060
absolutely right K is for name and V for
numbers these marks right?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11261-0
02:43:00.100 --> 02:43:05.740
Right so here is we are printing now we
will print. We are right here.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11262-0
02:43:08.140 --> 02:43:08.180
Uh.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11264-0
02:43:12.940 --> 02:43:13.460
Name.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11276-0
02:43:15.140 --> 02:43:23.020
OK. And name is what name is K, right?
And the then we have, right?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11281-0
02:43:24.700 --> 02:43:27.500
Marks Marks is what?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11284-0
02:43:29.780 --> 02:43:31.940
Marks is V right?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11319-0
02:43:33.500 --> 02:43:39.398
So that we are right and you are right
before that now see you know that's why

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11319-1
02:43:39.398 --> 02:43:45.521
you are checking what we have missed out
and all so once you will start doing the

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11319-2
02:43:45.521 --> 02:43:49.180
practise we can do the practise you can
go home.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11350-0
02:43:49.580 --> 02:43:55.088
And after that you will see the programme
and close it and start writing yourself.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11350-1
02:43:55.088 --> 02:44:00.530
So if something wrong you can match with
the programme so that way you can do the

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11350-2
02:44:00.530 --> 02:44:04.180
practise control CI have copied and I
have write here.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11368-0
02:44:07.180 --> 02:44:10.785
This time,
but this time we don't want to take from

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11368-1
02:44:10.785 --> 02:44:16.124
students marks from which one we want.
We have to check which one we have to

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11368-2
02:44:16.124 --> 02:44:16.540
check.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11405-0
02:44:18.620 --> 02:44:24.715
Here we have write students marks in
items but this time we want to show the

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11405-1
02:44:24.715 --> 02:44:28.593
past student.
So from where we have to check in.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11405-2
02:44:28.593 --> 02:44:33.660
In past students we have to write here in
past students got it.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11410-0
02:44:36.380 --> 02:44:39.420
So the same programme, now we'll go here.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11415-0
02:44:46.620 --> 02:44:49.180
I've killed the screen CLS.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11417-0
02:44:52.260 --> 02:44:53.020

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11419-0
02:44:54.820 --> 02:44:55.580
And marks.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11422-0
02:44:58.020 --> 02:44:58.940
We'll see the output.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11444-0
02:45:01.020 --> 02:45:04.372
The same from the same list we have make
it like this.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11444-1
02:45:04.372 --> 02:45:07.541

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11446-0
02:45:12.100 --> 02:45:12.580
You got it.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11456-0

will try to do that.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11463-0
02:45:22.940 --> 02:45:25.260
And after that we will start the next
topic.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11466-0
02:45:27.220 --> 02:45:27.980

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11473-0
02:45:38.780 --> 02:45:39.060
OK.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11496-0

just.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11498-0
02:46:45.980 --> 02:46:48.700
Huh. Yeah.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11521-0
02:46:50.660 --> 02:46:54.357
There is OK, just due to General City,
huh?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11521-1
02:46:54.357 --> 02:46:59.734
I thought there is some party or some
anniversary or something.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11521-2
02:46:59.734 --> 02:47:04.020
So normally on Friday we'll give oh,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11522-0
02:47:12.100 --> 02:47:12.700
Mm-hmm.

Every fighting might be 1X something, no?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11530-0
02:47:42.820 --> 02:47:42.940
Yeah.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11536-0
02:47:48.980 --> 02:47:50.100
I should ask the wise.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11537-0
02:47:52.780 --> 02:47:53.060
Anyway.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11538-0
02:47:57.100 --> 02:47:57.460
Done.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11541-0

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11568-0
02:48:39.500 --> 02:48:46.557
Sir, if you want to sort the marks,
it sort according to descending order.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11549-0
02:48:40.780 --> 02:48:41.220
Yes.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11568-1
02:48:46.557 --> 02:48:50.980
Can we do that for for this one for
visionary?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11570-0
02:48:52.540 --> 02:48:54.060
Or pass a student.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11569-0
02:48:53.620 --> 02:48:53.740
Yeah.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11571-0
02:48:57.380 --> 02:48:57.500
Yes.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11584-0
02:49:18.660 --> 02:49:23.620
We can do,
we can use the methods I already told you.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11585-0
02:49:26.260 --> 02:49:26.700
See you.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11591-0
02:49:28.300 --> 02:49:31.540
The sword and all you can use can do that.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11592-0
02:49:40.340 --> 02:49:40.940
I'm sorry you're not.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11630-0
02:52:10.580 --> 02:52:10.700
OK.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11632-0
02:52:14.540 --> 02:52:15.380
None, all of you.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11641-0
02:52:28.220 --> 02:52:32.340
For example this one you have,
this is your past students.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11652-0
02:52:33.780 --> 02:52:41.033
Now you want to short them, so even light.
Here you want to short based on the marks,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11652-1
02:52:41.033 --> 02:52:41.540
right?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11654-0
02:52:44.100 --> 02:52:46.500
So short.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11656-0
02:52:48.860 --> 02:52:49.820
Pass a student.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11661-0
02:52:53.420 --> 02:52:56.700
Pass a student.
So here is your dictionary.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11665-0
02:53:05.140 --> 02:53:08.060
Sorted Lambda.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11687-0
02:53:20.460 --> 02:53:28.136
We want to short the pass student,
so in place of this one we will write

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11687-1
02:53:28.136 --> 02:53:33.500
pass students pass students dot items and
here is.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11693-0
02:53:59.420 --> 02:54:00.020
Ellis.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11698-0
02:54:04.340 --> 02:54:05.780
It's doing harder.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11701-0
02:54:21.860 --> 02:54:21.980
But.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11702-0
02:54:31.300 --> 02:54:31.700
But.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11713-0
02:54:53.220 --> 02:54:56.660
Control is that this one.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11720-0
02:55:01.900 --> 02:55:06.620
So here is Karima. That's not sorted,
right?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11726-0
02:55:08.780 --> 02:55:11.460
947660 no.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11727-0
02:55:12.860 --> 02:55:13.140
OK.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11735-0
02:55:15.300 --> 02:55:18.420
Short based on name or ID which one you
want.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11742-0
02:55:21.780 --> 02:55:24.460
Based on the value based on the box.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11740-0
02:55:22.900 --> 02:55:23.020
OK.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11744-0
02:55:26.220 --> 02:55:26.460
Play song.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11747-0
02:55:26.340 --> 02:55:27.580
Based on marks, right?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11748-0
02:55:31.700 --> 02:55:31.940
Fine.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11761-0
02:55:36.580 --> 02:55:44.460
So based on marks marks is which one
marks is which one one no.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11766-0
02:55:44.180 --> 02:55:48.020
Boxes should be but what?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11765-0
02:55:46.780 --> 02:55:47.180
Box.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11771-0
02:55:49.460 --> 02:55:52.180
So when is your value right?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11775-0
02:55:53.540 --> 02:55:56.420
So here is we will generate.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11783-0
02:55:57.940 --> 02:56:01.820
So so I have to search this one,
I think he.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11788-0
02:56:03.540 --> 02:56:07.700
E is equal to Lambda.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11790-0
02:56:10.700 --> 02:56:11.900
And here is.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11794-0
02:56:30.060 --> 02:56:32.340
Sorted by E Lambda.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11800-0
02:56:36.780 --> 02:56:39.420
And he we have taken from this one.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11816-0
02:56:59.460 --> 02:57:03.882
Dictionary you don't have directly.
The short method we have to do some

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11816-1
02:57:03.882 --> 02:57:04.620
arrangement.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11823-0
02:57:29.180 --> 02:57:30.820
Shorted Lambda E.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11831-0
02:58:13.100 --> 02:58:13.140
I.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11832-0
02:58:20.740 --> 02:58:20.900
Not.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11833-0
02:58:23.140 --> 02:58:23.260
OK.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11836-0
02:58:25.660 --> 02:58:27.500
Not the correct send text words.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11852-0
02:58:37.580 --> 02:58:42.670
How about if for all the students,
no matter where the pass or field,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11852-1
02:58:42.670 --> 02:58:43.980
just want to sort?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11856-0
02:58:48.780 --> 02:58:49.820
You're done just a second.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11863-0
02:58:55.020 --> 02:58:59.220
This one is yes, so.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11868-0
02:59:02.140 --> 02:59:03.580
This is the syntax, just a SEC.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11870-0
02:59:10.900 --> 02:59:11.700
So shorted.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11886-0
02:59:16.540 --> 02:59:24.958
Pass the students dot items based on key,
reverse it through so it will do it in

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11886-1
02:59:24.958 --> 02:59:28.180
the descending order control E.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11913-0
02:59:32.140 --> 02:59:37.323
Neeraj, 36, SEM 60 Raj 55, Karima, 54.
This is descending order.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11913-1
02:59:37.323 --> 02:59:43.065
If you want in ascending order,
you will remove this one. Reverse true.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11913-2
02:59:43.065 --> 02:59:44.820
Then it will show you.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11914-0
02:59:45.940 --> 02:59:46.980
Play song.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/11958-0
02:59:47.340 --> 02:59:52.388

03:01:18.995 --> 03:01:25.241
Sam this is in ascending order if you
want in descending this is ascending.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12010-0
03:01:20.700 --> 03:01:20.780
The.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12015-0
03:01:22.260 --> 03:01:22.380
Yeah.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12025-2
03:01:25.241 --> 03:01:27.460
Let me write one more time.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12023-0
03:01:26.260 --> 03:01:26.380
Yeah.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12028-0
03:01:34.500 --> 03:01:34.620
Yeah.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12029-0
03:01:35.700 --> 03:01:36.660
This is ascending.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12031-0
03:01:37.860 --> 03:01:38.980
Descending you want.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12037-0
03:01:40.460 --> 03:01:43.660
This is descending order control V.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12036-0
03:01:43.140 --> 03:01:43.260
Yeah.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12038-0
03:01:45.020 --> 03:01:45.140
Yeah.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12040-0
03:01:53.340 --> 03:01:54.580
DESC.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12043-0
03:01:56.700 --> 03:01:57.500
Here is.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12042-0
03:01:57.300 --> 03:01:57.460
Yes.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12044-0
03:01:59.220 --> 03:02:00.020
Reverse.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12047-0
03:02:02.060 --> 03:02:03.620
Is equal to true.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12060-0
03:02:05.260 --> 03:02:08.538
So this is a reverse true.
Here is the reverse.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12060-1
03:02:08.538 --> 03:02:10.860
So this is let me just print here.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12061-0
03:02:15.220 --> 03:02:15.660
Print.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12069-0
03:02:17.900 --> 03:02:24.500
Sort pass a student DSC.
This is C double this is print.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12070-0
03:02:27.740 --> 03:02:28.340
Oh.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12073-0
03:02:30.700 --> 03:02:32.860
Ascending order.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12078-0
03:02:37.740 --> 03:02:39.900
And this is printed descending order.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12079-0
03:02:41.900 --> 03:02:42.300
Print.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12081-0
03:02:46.020 --> 03:02:47.260
Descending.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12087-0
03:02:48.540 --> 03:02:51.140
Order so that will be.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12135-0
03:02:56.100 --> 03:03:00.695
Complex. You can use the simple one.
First you will make it ascending and

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12135-1
03:03:00.695 --> 03:03:03.924
descending.
Then you can do the philtre after that.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12135-2
03:03:03.924 --> 03:03:08.208
But here you already have write the
things then you want to philtre.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12135-3
03:03:08.208 --> 03:03:12.058
That's also you can do that.
After that you want to short it.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12135-4
03:03:12.058 --> 03:03:15.660
So this is the ascending order.
The default is ascending.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12124-0
03:03:13.460 --> 03:03:13.580
Yeah.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12149-0
03:03:15.980 --> 03:03:19.504
If you want to descending,
you have to reverse as well.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12141-0
03:03:19.460 --> 03:03:19.580
Yeah.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12149-1
03:03:19.504 --> 03:03:24.100
Reverse meant ascending to become
descending. There are both the things.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12151-0
03:03:24.980 --> 03:03:25.860
OK. Thank you, Sir.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12152-0
03:03:26.660 --> 03:03:27.100
Yes, we go.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12171-0
03:04:43.740 --> 03:04:44.340
In public.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12173-0
03:04:53.300 --> 03:05:00.394
You have to do the.
That means you can be available for this

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12173-1
03:05:00.394 --> 03:05:00.860
8.4.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12181-0
03:05:02.220 --> 03:05:10.774
When it goes, when it goes with,
you simply points from here.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12181-1
03:05:10.774 --> 03:05:14.500
But if I'm picking one way.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12194-0
03:05:31.340 --> 03:05:35.300
And if you want to convert it to
dictionary you will light here one more.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12195-0
03:05:37.500 --> 03:05:37.980
Action, Ed.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12197-0
03:05:43.740 --> 03:05:45.140
Right, similarly here.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12200-0
03:06:01.100 --> 03:06:01.660
Dictionary.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12235-0
03:06:03.740 --> 03:06:10.093
Output will not change here is it will
that build bracket has become the curly

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12235-1
03:06:10.093 --> 03:06:13.954
braces.
Now if you want in the same format like

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12235-2
03:06:13.954 --> 03:06:17.895
this one.
So you can copy paste this and it will

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12235-3
03:06:17.895 --> 03:06:18.700
also work.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12240-0
03:06:19.780 --> 03:06:21.940
The folder should I write?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12248-0
03:06:23.300 --> 03:06:28.820
It's a copy paste from here control C and
you can paste it here.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12286-0
03:06:33.620 --> 03:06:38.946
Should I write one function to do that?
No. Otherwise it will be too much for you,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12286-1
03:06:38.946 --> 03:06:41.963
huh?
I can write one function so every time we

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12286-2
03:06:41.963 --> 03:06:46.070
need not to write this code,
we just pass that one. OK. Anyway,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12286-3
03:06:46.070 --> 03:06:49.343
let me write this one first,
then I will show you.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12286-4
03:06:49.343 --> 03:06:50.820
We'll use the function.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12289-0
03:06:51.940 --> 03:06:55.100
Joe here is control X.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12294-0
03:06:59.140 --> 03:07:03.740
Controlling and here is.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12318-0
03:07:06.060 --> 03:07:16.294
Descending one you will copy this control
C and you paste it here Control V and in

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12318-1
03:07:16.294 --> 03:07:20.980
place of this short pass students PSC.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12319-0
03:07:25.300 --> 03:07:26.140
The ESC.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12322-0
03:07:27.340 --> 03:07:29.020
And here is control.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12343-0
03:07:31.620 --> 03:07:37.322
No, here this is new ascending order.
This is descending order descending order.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12343-1
03:07:37.322 --> 03:07:42.180
This is due to only based on the marks
not based on the name, right.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12350-0
03:08:10.420 --> 03:08:11.340
Dictionary and.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12364-0
03:08:13.380 --> 03:08:17.131
If you are using without dictionary,
it is not the dictionary,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12364-1
03:08:17.131 --> 03:08:18.620
it will be even this one.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12396-0
03:08:21.540 --> 03:08:24.617
One list it will be a list in the list
format.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12396-1
03:08:24.617 --> 03:08:27.759
It will show you just the collection.
See here.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12396-2
03:08:27.759 --> 03:08:32.473
Then you can't use this function.
This one you are using here this full

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12396-3
03:08:32.473 --> 03:08:37.580
loop if you are using without dictionary
so you can't traverse like this one.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12398-0
03:08:44.940 --> 03:08:46.100
We have see.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12401-0
03:08:48.660 --> 03:08:49.300
Let me show you.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12419-0
03:08:52.660 --> 03:08:57.968
I'm showing one more to you.
I'm writing here control P this is

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12419-1
03:08:57.968 --> 03:09:03.940
without dictionary. You want, right?
So I'm writing here just a second.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12430-0
03:09:06.260 --> 03:09:08.857
For her only.
So if you don't want to write,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12430-1
03:09:08.857 --> 03:09:11.860
you can leave it. Fine.
So this one is I'm writing.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12439-0
03:09:16.180 --> 03:09:21.460
The Blue Dictionary without dictionary,
right? So I have printed.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12440-0
03:09:22.940 --> 03:09:23.740
Start.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12443-0
03:09:26.780 --> 03:09:28.700
Listen just to show.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12481-0
03:09:30.060 --> 03:09:34.306
This one question he asked without this
one, how is it so?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12481-1
03:09:34.306 --> 03:09:39.416
Where is this is without dictionary? Fine.
We'll see. It's. How is it?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12481-2
03:09:39.416 --> 03:09:43.806
It's not in curly braces.
It's not in the dictionary. Right.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12481-3
03:09:43.806 --> 03:09:49.780
And if you use the for loop it will give
you the error. It will not work that way.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12484-0
03:09:50.700 --> 03:09:52.980
So this is without one.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12487-0
03:09:54.540 --> 03:09:55.340
Should I remove it?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12519-0
03:09:58.700 --> 03:10:02.497
I want to show you when if we want to
print through a method,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12519-1
03:10:02.497 --> 03:10:05.436
what the benefit you will get.
I will show you.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12519-2
03:10:05.436 --> 03:10:10.275
First you will do this then I will show
you that you will do because otherwise

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12519-3
03:10:10.275 --> 03:10:13.460
we'll be too much.
So you will do up to this level.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12521-0
03:10:14.420 --> 03:10:15.420
A bit so G.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12524-0
03:10:17.220 --> 03:10:20.060
This theorist.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12559-0
03:10:21.380 --> 03:10:26.050
Fine. So first we have created.
Let me explain it one by one. First,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12559-1
03:10:26.050 --> 03:10:30.721
we have created a dictionary, right?
This is the student dictionary.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12559-2
03:10:30.721 --> 03:10:35.866
It have the name and the number.
Then we have write print all the students.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12559-3
03:10:35.866 --> 03:10:38.100
We have printed all the students.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12603-0
03:10:38.660 --> 03:10:44.145
We will go to the dictionary.
K is for Key, V for value in students,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12603-1
03:10:44.145 --> 03:10:48.757
marks dot items.
So this K is denote to the name and V is

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12603-2
03:10:48.757 --> 03:10:52.414
number.
Here we have displayed the number and

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12603-3
03:10:52.414 --> 03:10:57.980
then the sorry name and then the marks.
So name is K for example Sam.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12616-0
03:10:58.340 --> 03:11:03.981
And marks is 60,
Raj 55 May 35 Sunday this all we have up

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12616-1
03:11:03.981 --> 03:11:06.900
to Garima. 54 We have display.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12617-0
03:11:08.260 --> 03:11:08.780
No.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12667-0
03:11:10.060 --> 03:11:15.852
This is the this is all students you want
to print. You can print all the student.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12667-1
03:11:15.852 --> 03:11:21.504
Now we want only the pass student so we
have right here pass student dictionary.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12667-2
03:11:21.504 --> 03:11:27.296
We'll go to convert it to the dictionary
we have filtered it based on the students

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12667-3
03:11:27.296 --> 03:11:29.460
who have greater than 50 marks.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12703-0
03:11:29.860 --> 03:11:36.841
And we have put inside the pass students.
We have displayed the pass student right

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12703-1
03:11:36.841 --> 03:11:43.150
then one is asked can we short it.
So we have shorted the default short is

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12703-2
03:11:43.150 --> 03:11:49.460
ascending order we have displayed here in
the ascending order of shorting.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12735-0
03:11:50.580 --> 03:11:55.397
Fine. Then we have created again.
We have do it in the descending order in

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12735-1
03:11:55.397 --> 03:12:00.793
the descending order. If you want to do,
you have to just reverse is equal to true.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12735-2
03:12:00.793 --> 03:12:05.740
The same code will be there just you have
right reverse it is equal to true.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12738-0
03:12:06.020 --> 03:12:07.940
Then we have printed the descending order.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12795-0
03:12:09.340 --> 03:12:14.508
So we have print here one we have print
here two we have print here 3 if you want

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12795-1
03:12:14.508 --> 03:12:19.487
to print here as well this is 4 so four
time we have print we have written the

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12795-2
03:12:19.487 --> 03:12:24.340
same code four time so this code is
repetitive this code we can put inside a

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12795-3
03:12:24.340 --> 03:12:28.500
function and we will pass the value and
it will print every time.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12799-0
03:12:28.900 --> 03:12:31.220
I can show you that also if you want,
otherwise it's OK.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12800-0
03:12:35.900 --> 03:12:36.100
Deep.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12804-0
03:12:37.420 --> 03:12:39.340
You should, so I'm sorry.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12829-0
03:12:41.820 --> 03:12:47.754
The first students to items is just to
short to display,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12829-1
03:12:47.754 --> 03:12:54.417
display the key and then the short short
is just to order them.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12829-2
03:12:54.417 --> 03:12:57.020
Order them first is that.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12830-0
03:12:58.500 --> 03:12:58.780
Oh.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12832-0
03:13:04.460 --> 03:13:05.060
It's me.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12834-0
03:13:06.660 --> 03:13:07.260
Causes to know.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12869-0
03:13:11.460 --> 03:13:16.130
Because we want to,
let me tell you key is equal to Lambda

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12869-1
03:13:16.130 --> 03:13:20.958
XX1. What that means?
It means the shorting on based on what

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12869-2
03:13:20.958 --> 03:13:26.500
you want to do the shorting we want to do
the shorting based on name.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12911-0
03:13:26.820 --> 03:13:30.272
Or you want to do the shorting base on
value.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12911-1
03:13:30.272 --> 03:13:34.326
So if you want to do the shorting based
on the value,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12911-2
03:13:34.326 --> 03:13:40.556
for example we want to do shorting based
on the 11 means this is 0 very much 01 is

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12911-3
03:13:40.556 --> 03:13:44.009
marks.
So we want to do the shorting based on

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12911-4
03:13:44.009 --> 03:13:44.460
marks.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12953-0
03:13:44.900 --> 03:13:48.663
If you write 0 then it will short based
on the name,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12953-1
03:13:48.663 --> 03:13:54.273
so we don't want based on the name we
want based on the marks who have got the

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12953-2
03:13:54.273 --> 03:13:59.882
last mark then he will come then next
here who have got the highest marks that

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12953-3
03:13:59.882 --> 03:14:03.220
will come then the next highest then so
on so.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12970-0
03:14:04.100 --> 03:14:07.330
OK,
so we want to do the shorting based on

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12970-1
03:14:07.330 --> 03:14:13.340
the. The key means the key the term.
Based on that you want to do the shorting.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12975-0
03:14:14.780 --> 03:14:16.420
The key to do the shorting.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12988-0
03:14:29.020 --> 03:14:33.109
If we don't put the key here,
you are asking if we don't put this one

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12988-1
03:14:33.109 --> 03:14:33.460
right.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12994-0
03:14:35.580 --> 03:14:37.460
If you have not put the key, see here.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/12995-0
03:14:40.180 --> 03:14:41.020
See you soon.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13023-0
03:14:45.420 --> 03:14:52.038
You have not put the key where by the
sending the Garima 5476 it's does do

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13023-1
03:14:52.038 --> 03:14:56.804
nothing 5476.
It's not doing the shorting because you

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13023-2
03:14:56.804 --> 03:14:59.540
don't know how to do the short.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13024-0
03:15:00.500 --> 03:15:00.620
Yeah.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13025-0
03:15:07.340 --> 03:15:07.500
It's.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13026-0
03:15:14.580 --> 03:15:14.860
Where?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13042-0
03:15:16.540 --> 03:15:23.055
Student when we feel philtre yes,
after the philtre and bracket this,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13042-1
03:15:23.055 --> 03:15:26.220
this one, this one you are asking.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13074-0
03:15:28.020 --> 03:15:33.552
Here, here is why. Why is it here?
Is what we have right here. Here we have,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13074-1
03:15:33.552 --> 03:15:38.654
right. I. You can write any word.
Here is the I should be greater than

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13074-2
03:15:38.654 --> 03:15:43.900
equal to 50. We have read the condition.
The key should be greater than.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13104-0
03:15:44.300 --> 03:15:48.211
50 you want.
You have the confusion with this one,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13104-1
03:15:48.211 --> 03:15:51.893
right? Yeah.
You you have right to this Lambda.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13104-2
03:15:51.893 --> 03:15:55.421
This is key is actually here is for
shorting.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13104-3
03:15:55.421 --> 03:15:59.180
There is a keyword key that you have to
use key.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13125-0
03:15:59.500 --> 03:16:03.022
Fine.
And this is you can give any name to this

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13125-1
03:16:03.022 --> 03:16:06.545
one ABCD.
Here we have the given I we can write

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13125-2
03:16:06.545 --> 03:16:08.820
here X also if you want X here.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13157-0
03:16:13.980 --> 03:16:18.022
Right, this is not related. This is XXI.
It's not an issue,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13157-1
03:16:18.022 --> 03:16:23.480
but that key is means on based on what
you want to do the shorting. For example,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13157-2
03:16:23.480 --> 03:16:26.580
if you have right here zero,
let me show you.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13168-0
03:16:27.060 --> 03:16:33.162
The rate is 0 here.
Also you have rate the zero fine.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13168-1
03:16:33.162 --> 03:16:36.100
Let me show you control E.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13170-0
03:16:40.100 --> 03:16:40.940
Earless.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13173-0
03:16:44.180 --> 03:16:45.380
What you will see here.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13198-0
03:16:47.700 --> 03:17:02.940
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNO right. So first is G,
then N, then R, then S and then name SRNG.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13238-0
03:17:03.580 --> 03:17:09.409
0 means it's doing the shorting base on
name 1 means it's doing the shorting base

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13238-1
03:17:09.409 --> 03:17:12.964
on marks. You got it from there.
I'm telling you,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13238-2
03:17:12.964 --> 03:17:17.514
just zero means the first thing and the
one means the next one.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13238-3
03:17:17.514 --> 03:17:21.140
If you want to do the short,
that's why I ask him.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13259-0
03:17:21.380 --> 03:17:26.728
On which one you want to do the shorting
based on name or based on marks, he says.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13259-1
03:17:26.728 --> 03:17:30.273
Sir, I want based on marks,
so that's why I write one.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13259-2
03:17:30.273 --> 03:17:32.980
If he said based on name then I put the 0.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13261-0
03:17:34.220 --> 03:17:34.820
You got it.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13262-0
03:17:36.540 --> 03:17:37.020
That's that.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13301-0
03:17:43.380 --> 03:17:48.012
So everything have the importance.
That's why I've asked which one you want,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13301-1
03:17:48.012 --> 03:17:51.019
he said no,
I want based on the marks who get the

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13301-2
03:17:51.019 --> 03:17:54.629
marks 1st and so on.
So if someone say we want the shorting

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13301-3
03:17:54.629 --> 03:17:57.997
based on the name,
so then you have right here what you

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13301-4
03:17:57.997 --> 03:17:58.780
would like 0.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13304-0
03:18:03.980 --> 03:18:04.740
Let them write.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13308-0
03:18:08.380 --> 03:18:10.420
Kill it. All of you online as well.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13311-0
03:18:14.420 --> 03:18:15.380
Clear, clear answer.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13318-0
03:18:14.820 --> 03:18:18.500
To to to Philtre and short based on that.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13319-0
03:18:19.900 --> 03:18:20.020
Yeah.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13362-0
03:18:23.540 --> 03:18:27.197
Based on what you want,
this is the key of shorting.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13362-1
03:18:27.197 --> 03:18:33.063
Based on that, what you want to do short,
right? If based on name you want to do so,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13362-2
03:18:33.063 --> 03:18:36.513
then you can write 0 so it will do the
base on 0.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13362-3
03:18:36.513 --> 03:18:41.620
The shorting key means the way the key
for shorting, that's that meaning.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13363-0
03:18:41.860 --> 03:18:41.980
Yeah.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13380-0
03:18:44.140 --> 03:18:47.052
I have showed you you can put the zero in
place of one.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13380-1
03:18:47.052 --> 03:18:51.420
You will see that it will short based on
the name. The names you have in your list.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13390-0
03:19:54.700 --> 03:19:54.780
Is.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13393-0
03:20:05.780 --> 03:20:06.140
I think.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13394-0
03:20:11.700 --> 03:20:11.980
Listen.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13395-0
03:20:24.740 --> 03:20:24.860
I.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13399-0
03:20:30.580 --> 03:20:31.140
Secret.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13400-0
03:20:48.860 --> 03:20:50.260
It was taking for the me.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13406-0
03:20:55.660 --> 03:20:56.020
This.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13408-0
03:21:08.660 --> 03:21:08.980
Pardon.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13421-0
03:22:03.620 --> 03:22:03.820
Up.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13454-0
03:24:04.140 --> 03:24:04.420
Done.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13456-0
03:24:08.900 --> 03:24:09.820
Stuck somewhere?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13465-0
03:24:51.460 --> 03:24:51.740
Hello.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13470-0
03:24:52.620 --> 03:24:53.020
Yes.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13489-0
03:24:55.140 --> 03:25:04.838
Determine if we write the code and the
terminal run as long as the terminal run

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13489-1
03:25:04.838 --> 03:25:06.900
well, no problem.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13500-0
03:25:11.980 --> 03:25:15.180
So you do what terminal learning. Well,
you will go here.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13506-0
03:25:16.820 --> 03:25:17.540
Yeah, let's.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13526-0
03:25:16.820 --> 03:25:21.488
Yeah. I mean,
if we if we write the code before we run

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13526-1
03:25:21.488 --> 03:25:26.581
the terminal, right,
and we after write the code and we run

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13512-0
03:25:21.820 --> 03:25:22.100
Hmm.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13526-2
03:25:26.581 --> 03:25:31.420
the terminal as long as the terminal show
we the result.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13532-0
03:25:32.380 --> 03:25:35.100
It's all. No problem. Is it OK?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13538-0
03:25:35.540 --> 03:25:38.420
If it is showing you the correct result,
then no problem.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13541-0
03:25:40.620 --> 03:25:41.820
OK. Thank you, Sir.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13553-0
03:25:43.860 --> 03:25:48.865
You have to check what result do you want,
right? So that's also you have to check.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13553-1
03:25:48.865 --> 03:25:49.580
Fine so now.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13559-0
03:25:53.540 --> 03:25:55.900
OK, done this one. All of you clear.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13588-0
03:26:05.300 --> 03:26:09.655
OK. Let me just go here. Philtre,
we have done map.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13588-1
03:26:09.655 --> 03:26:16.438
We have done even the short one we have
done so here is the question you can ask

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13588-2
03:26:16.438 --> 03:26:20.793
to yourself,
right all of you what is a function in

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13588-3
03:26:20.793 --> 03:26:21.380
Python?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13597-0
03:26:25.180 --> 03:26:28.340
Ask to yourself just in your mind what is
function in Python.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13601-0
03:26:32.020 --> 03:26:33.300
Have you asked to yourself?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13606-0
03:26:36.500 --> 03:26:39.260
So what do you look good?
What is the answer?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13650-0
03:26:42.060 --> 03:26:49.153
Function is a block of code that we will
write and we can call it whenever is

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13650-1
03:26:49.153 --> 03:26:53.155
required.
We can pass the parameters in the

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13650-2
03:26:53.155 --> 03:26:58.247
functions right,
so function is a block of code that we

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13650-3
03:26:58.247 --> 03:27:01.340
can write. We can use it whenever.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13684-0
03:27:01.460 --> 03:27:07.077
Is required fine to function.
We can pass the parameters to the

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13684-1
03:27:07.077 --> 03:27:12.958
functions and function is to enhance the
readability, reusability,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13684-2
03:27:12.958 --> 03:27:17.260
modularity and makes the debugging easy
for you.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13704-0
03:27:18.180 --> 03:27:24.673
How to define a function with default
parameters so you know how to define the

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13704-1
03:27:24.673 --> 03:27:30.180
function with default parameters?
All of you how will I go to now?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13718-0
03:27:32.220 --> 03:27:35.614
So you know,
so you know how to define a function

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13718-1
03:27:35.614 --> 03:27:37.380
without default parameter.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13731-0
03:27:39.100 --> 03:27:42.968
With the default parameter,
sorry with default parameters.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13731-1
03:27:42.968 --> 03:27:47.100
How we'll define we'll lay to the
function. Let's say welcome.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13778-0
03:27:48.420 --> 03:27:51.531
And,
but let's say we want to define our

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13778-1
03:27:51.531 --> 03:27:55.401
functions,
let's say welcome and in the welcome we

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13778-2
03:27:55.401 --> 03:28:01.245
have write title is equal to Mr or Miss
default right and then comma we have

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13778-3
03:28:01.245 --> 03:28:05.570
write the name.
So we are write the name and then we are

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13778-4
03:28:05.570 --> 03:28:07.620
write the title Mr or Miss.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13826-0
03:28:07.980 --> 03:28:13.295
By default if user have enter Mr so it
will give the Mr or if you enter miss it

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13826-1
03:28:13.295 --> 03:28:17.348
will give the miss.
But if you have not enter anything Mr or

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13826-2
03:28:17.348 --> 03:28:22.730
miss so it's automatically show you Mr or
miss both things written there got it.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13826-3
03:28:22.730 --> 03:28:27.780
For example we have take the name ID and
city and city default we have set.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13862-0
03:28:28.980 --> 03:28:32.413
This KL right so if user have entered the
city,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13862-1
03:28:32.413 --> 03:28:37.920
let's say I have entered New Delhi but
you have not entered any city so your

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13862-2
03:28:37.920 --> 03:28:42.354
city by default will be KL so that is the
default parameters.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13862-3
03:28:42.354 --> 03:28:44.500
Then what is Lambda functions?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13870-0
03:28:46.420 --> 03:28:48.820
That you have just done.
What is Lambda function?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13875-0
03:28:52.300 --> 03:28:54.060
Michelle, what is Lambda function?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13911-0
03:28:59.380 --> 03:29:03.710
The Lambda functions are function that
don't have the name.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13911-1
03:29:03.710 --> 03:29:09.411
We will write one liner like you have
write add and you have write here column

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13911-2
03:29:09.411 --> 03:29:13.020
AB then the Lambda you have write A+B so
that is.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13917-0
03:29:13.300 --> 03:29:16.332
One liner function.
Those are known as Lambda function.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13917-1
03:29:16.332 --> 03:29:16.820
See here.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13960-0
03:29:18.620 --> 03:29:22.412
This one.
This is a Lambda function Lambda X comma

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13960-1
03:29:22.412 --> 03:29:26.353
yx plus Y.
So add is equal to Lambda X comma Y colon

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13960-2
03:29:26.353 --> 03:29:29.997
X + y.
This is the Lambda function I have showed

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13960-3
03:29:29.997 --> 03:29:35.500
you add average multiply division.
I have showed you those methods right?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13965-0
03:29:36.180 --> 03:29:38.700
And the that's still a Lambda function.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13974-0
03:29:41.420 --> 03:29:46.060
Then difference between map and philtre
what map do?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13999-0
03:29:50.420 --> 03:29:54.516
Philtre is philtre out the data and map
is based on your criteria.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13999-1
03:29:54.516 --> 03:29:58.735
It will show you see here.
This is the example of map you have done.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/13999-2
03:29:58.735 --> 03:30:00.020
Let me show you here.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14000-0
03:30:02.500 --> 03:30:02.540
Uh.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14037-0
03:30:04.980 --> 03:30:10.467
Map you have done the this is map example
map list Lambda 2X numbers.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14037-1
03:30:10.467 --> 03:30:16.659
So based on the things you want to do
multiply to each and every number of the

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14037-2
03:30:16.659 --> 03:30:21.205
list. It will do.
It will do the mapping of that and give

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14037-3
03:30:21.205 --> 03:30:22.460
you that things.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14067-0
03:30:22.900 --> 03:30:28.970
Then the next one is philtre philtre it
philtre means you want to philtre the

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14067-1
03:30:28.970 --> 03:30:34.107
database on a criteria.
For example you want to find out the data

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14067-2
03:30:34.107 --> 03:30:38.700
that is divisible by two the numbers or
even numbers only.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14103-0
03:30:39.020 --> 03:30:42.677
Or you want the pass student only or fail
student only,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14103-1
03:30:42.677 --> 03:30:47.379
so those things you want to do,
you can use the philtre in that case if

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14103-2
03:30:47.379 --> 03:30:52.147
you want to philtre out the data,
these things you should know since you

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14103-3
03:30:52.147 --> 03:30:53.780
should practise later on.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14142-0
03:30:54.420 --> 03:30:59.250
Once you will start the advanced topic,
there you have to use these and that time

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14142-1
03:30:59.250 --> 03:31:03.726
we will not discuss what he's doing.
We just discuss the other stuff there.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14142-2
03:31:03.726 --> 03:31:08.438
That will be the part for example input
print that we have discussed in the day

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14142-3
03:31:08.438 --> 03:31:11.030
one.
Now we are not discussing those things

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14142-4
03:31:11.030 --> 03:31:13.740
because you already know what input is
doing.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14166-0
03:31:13.820 --> 03:31:17.686
And what print is doing later on once you
already know this?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14166-1
03:31:17.686 --> 03:31:20.538
What function is doing what Lambda is
doing,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14166-2
03:31:20.538 --> 03:31:24.531
what this doing so then you need not to
focus on these things.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14166-3
03:31:24.531 --> 03:31:26.940
You will focus to other topics, right?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14168-0
03:31:28.620 --> 03:31:29.180
So.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14202-0
03:31:33.180 --> 03:31:38.512
A function in Python is a block of
reusable code that perform a specific

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14202-1
03:31:38.512 --> 03:31:41.799
task.
Function helps make your code modular,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14202-2
03:31:41.799 --> 03:31:47.423
organised and easier to maintain.
Thank you. Now let's start. The next step.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14202-3
03:31:47.423 --> 03:31:49.980
Should we start the next topic now?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14203-0
03:31:52.540 --> 03:31:52.740
Right.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14204-0
03:31:54.300 --> 03:31:54.700
Done.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14207-0
03:31:57.580 --> 03:32:00.300
OK, next is.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14214-0
03:32:07.540 --> 03:32:10.580
Object oriented programming in Python.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14221-0
03:32:14.100 --> 03:32:17.500
Let me upload this content up no now.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14225-0
03:32:19.140 --> 03:32:21.100
This is the day for no this note.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14228-0
03:32:22.940 --> 03:32:23.820
Where is your.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14243-0
03:32:27.300 --> 03:32:31.847
So what we have done up to now,
let me upload it. You can check from here.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14243-1
03:32:31.847 --> 03:32:33.060
This is your folder.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14245-0
03:32:36.980 --> 03:32:37.980
Page #5.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14249-0
03:32:40.220 --> 03:32:41.700
Open in terminal.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14254-0
03:32:43.540 --> 03:32:49.740
Click Add all click permit by fund M.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14258-0
03:32:52.300 --> 03:32:55.620
Define before.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14261-0
03:32:57.540 --> 03:33:00.660
Starting object.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14263-0
03:33:02.580 --> 03:33:03.500
Oriented.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14266-0
03:33:05.340 --> 03:33:06.300
Programming.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14268-0
03:33:07.660 --> 03:33:09.420
Isn't quite done.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14271-0
03:33:14.940 --> 03:33:16.220
Good push.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14277-0
03:33:19.860 --> 03:33:23.140
I have push it here. We'll see here.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14281-0
03:33:38.620 --> 03:33:40.380
The number 5.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14294-0
03:33:43.580 --> 03:33:49.300
So here we have what we have done philtre,
Lambda, map recap. Other things are there,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14294-1
03:33:49.300 --> 03:33:49.700
right?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14304-0
03:33:51.380 --> 03:33:55.740
This is 2 days contained up to now.
The next thing we are going to discuss is.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14307-0
03:33:58.540 --> 03:33:59.740
Object oriented programme.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14317-0
03:34:05.260 --> 03:34:08.469
So the evening break is not required
today because we already have taken a

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14317-1
03:34:08.469 --> 03:34:08.940
long break.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14321-0
03:34:11.580 --> 03:34:13.900
So here is we'll go.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14325-0
03:34:15.740 --> 03:34:17.140
So object oriented programming.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14335-0
03:34:19.260 --> 03:34:24.940
See, I will tell you a bit theory first,
then practical we will do right.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14365-0
03:34:35.420 --> 03:34:41.856
So the agenda is we are going to discuss
what is object oriented programme,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14365-1
03:34:41.856 --> 03:34:47.700
we are going to define the class creating
objects, methods, classes,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14365-2
03:34:47.700 --> 03:34:50.580
object constructor, heads on labs.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14377-0
03:34:50.860 --> 03:34:54.280
And after that,
the assessment quid will be there.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14377-1
03:34:54.280 --> 03:34:57.700
So what is object oriented programme
first of all?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14410-0
03:34:59.660 --> 03:35:03.128
See, you know, up to now,
what do you have done?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14410-1
03:35:03.128 --> 03:35:08.295
You have seen the functions up to now,
right? Let me tell you the story,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14410-2
03:35:08.295 --> 03:35:14.100
how the programming is started and what
the meaning of object oriented programme.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14455-0
03:35:14.740 --> 03:35:18.595
See first of all,
the once the the this computers is

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14455-1
03:35:18.595 --> 03:35:24.560
created now so that time the people who
is dealing with the computer they will go

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14455-2
03:35:24.560 --> 03:35:28.778
and write 010101.
That way they will lie to the programme

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14455-3
03:35:28.778 --> 03:35:32.197
there.
So they will try to understand the they

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14455-4
03:35:32.197 --> 03:35:34.380
talk directly to the computer.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14504-0
03:35:34.420 --> 03:35:37.893
Computer,
that language was the 01 binary language.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14504-1
03:35:37.893 --> 03:35:42.836
I'm telling you the story I will reach to
this object oriented programme.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14504-2
03:35:42.836 --> 03:35:48.247
I will take 5 minutes of your time right?
So after that the next thing will come

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14504-3
03:35:48.247 --> 03:35:51.253
out.
They think it's too tough to write a 01

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14504-4
03:35:51.253 --> 03:35:54.260
and remember.
So they have made these 01/01.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14538-0
03:35:54.340 --> 03:35:57.684
One,
they have make small small word that is

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14538-1
03:35:57.684 --> 03:36:03.257
known as mean only mix the small words
they have write and they have start

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14538-2
03:36:03.257 --> 03:36:09.053
writing the assembly language so that
assembly language later on convert into

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14538-3
03:36:09.053 --> 03:36:10.020
this 01 also.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14580-0
03:36:10.580 --> 03:36:15.164
Then later on they have started creating
the high level language,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14580-1
03:36:15.164 --> 03:36:20.512
but those languages that is function
oriented function or procedure oriented

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14580-2
03:36:20.512 --> 03:36:24.054
languages.
So procedure means for example you want

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14580-3
03:36:24.054 --> 03:36:28.291
to calculate the bonus,
you'll write the function and you'll

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14580-4
03:36:28.291 --> 03:36:29.820
calculate it you want.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14614-0
03:36:29.900 --> 03:36:33.529
You want to do the average.
You will let the average function.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14614-1
03:36:33.529 --> 03:36:36.237
You will do it whatever the function you
need.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14614-2
03:36:36.237 --> 03:36:39.118
You need to do some sort of transaction
for that.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14614-3
03:36:39.118 --> 03:36:41.711
They will write the function and they do
it.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14614-4
03:36:41.711 --> 03:36:45.860
That is known as procedural programming
or function oriented programme.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14647-0
03:36:46.300 --> 03:36:52.153
But that is also not that's so cool.
So they have is then this object oriented

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14647-1
03:36:52.153 --> 03:36:58.154
programming is come out into the picture.
Which one object oriented programming.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14647-2
03:36:58.154 --> 03:37:03.860
So what is object oriented programming?
For example you want to design this.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14671-0
03:37:05.340 --> 03:37:11.198
Institute or Academy? Right. So what?
We will think what we need to design.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14671-1
03:37:11.198 --> 03:37:16.979
I'm telling you the real time thing first.
What we need to design Academy.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14671-2
03:37:16.979 --> 03:37:20.140
We need the trainers. We need projectors.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14694-0
03:37:20.700 --> 03:37:25.746
We need laptops. We know chairs,
we need tables. Fine.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14694-1
03:37:25.746 --> 03:37:31.709
So those sort of things we need.
So all the things that we need,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14694-2
03:37:31.709 --> 03:37:33.820
we have make the group.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14742-0
03:37:35.460 --> 03:37:39.763
And give a name so that group is a
blueprint, for example,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14742-1
03:37:39.763 --> 03:37:44.722
that is known as here class.
So we have put all the group together.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14742-2
03:37:44.722 --> 03:37:49.098
Then we have a start creating the
instance of those things.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14742-3
03:37:49.098 --> 03:37:54.860
For example we have make the group of
chairs right, then every chair might be.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14772-0
03:37:54.940 --> 03:37:58.950
The different characteristic one chair is
rolling chair.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14772-1
03:37:58.950 --> 03:38:03.875
One chair is the simple chair,
one is big chair, one is wooden chair,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14772-2
03:38:03.875 --> 03:38:09.081
one so different, different. Similarly,
the employees they might have the

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14772-3
03:38:09.081 --> 03:38:10.700
different thing one is.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14804-0
03:38:11.660 --> 03:38:17.771
Let's say one is pion, one is the colour,
one is CEO, one is trainer,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14804-1
03:38:17.771 --> 03:38:23.359
one is the accountant, right?
They have the different different

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14804-2
03:38:23.359 --> 03:38:28.073
categories.
So in object oriented programming we will

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14804-3
03:38:28.073 --> 03:38:29.820
focus on the object.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14834-0
03:38:30.580 --> 03:38:35.756
We will focus on the object based on the
object. We will create the project.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14834-1
03:38:35.756 --> 03:38:39.453
We will not create the project based on
functionality,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14834-2
03:38:39.453 --> 03:38:44.562
but we will create the object based on.
We will create the project based on

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14834-3
03:38:44.562 --> 03:38:45.100
objects.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14866-0
03:38:45.460 --> 03:38:51.125
So that is object oriented programme.
For example you want to create a project

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14866-1
03:38:51.125 --> 03:38:55.572
on employee management.
So what you will think you will think

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14866-2
03:38:55.572 --> 03:38:59.660
about the employee.
So first the all the things that the

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14866-3
03:38:59.660 --> 03:39:01.740
similar we will make a class.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14916-0
03:39:02.100 --> 03:39:06.020
The class is a object factory or a
blueprint of object.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14916-1
03:39:06.020 --> 03:39:11.130
So we will think about employee so
employee have how many characteristic

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14916-2
03:39:11.130 --> 03:39:15.540
what employee can do,
what things we need so employee can have

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14916-3
03:39:15.540 --> 03:39:21.420
his ID. Everyone should have a unique ID,
employee ID. Everyone should have a name.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14955-0
03:39:21.820 --> 03:39:24.427
Everyone should have a qualification,
right?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14955-1
03:39:24.427 --> 03:39:27.499
And they have some sort of task that they
are doing.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14955-2
03:39:27.499 --> 03:39:31.903
They have some sort of the timing which
time they are coming to the office,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14955-3
03:39:31.903 --> 03:39:36.134
what time they are going to office.
They have some sort of salary. Fine.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/14955-4
03:39:36.134 --> 03:39:39.380
So those things that is required,
we will put together.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15002-0
03:39:39.660 --> 03:39:45.685
So we will make a combination of that one
now let's say the employee come out Adila

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15002-1
03:39:45.685 --> 03:39:50.635
is the first employee for example.
So Adila is a real time entity of

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15002-2
03:39:50.635 --> 03:39:55.513
employee class. Then she is,
Samina is the another employee, right?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15002-3
03:39:55.513 --> 03:39:59.100
So she also have one ID she have for
example one.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15033-0
03:39:59.420 --> 03:40:03.974
You have two. Misha, have three.
You have four and you have 5. Ma'am,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15033-1
03:40:03.974 --> 03:40:09.048
have six. So they have different ID,
different name, different qualification.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15033-2
03:40:09.048 --> 03:40:13.017
Different different timing.
Or maybe same timing. It's fine.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15033-3
03:40:13.017 --> 03:40:15.620
So the class is a collection of objects.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15081-0
03:40:16.180 --> 03:40:19.546
So we will create the object,
then the task, the task,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15081-1
03:40:19.546 --> 03:40:23.832
what the task they are doing,
the task we will define by the function

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15081-2
03:40:23.832 --> 03:40:27.994
you have seen the functions.
So the task of that one we will define

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15081-3
03:40:27.994 --> 03:40:31.851
with the functions.
Then after that that other employees have.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15081-4
03:40:31.851 --> 03:40:34.300
Then after that we can divide them also.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15119-0
03:40:34.700 --> 03:40:37.522
So that class is known as generalised
class.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15119-1
03:40:37.522 --> 03:40:42.665
Then after that we divide the employee.
Also if you have very big organisation so

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15119-2
03:40:42.665 --> 03:40:46.177
the the similar kind of employee together
the employee.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15119-3
03:40:46.177 --> 03:40:50.380
For example let's say the faculties all
the trainers in one class.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15155-0
03:40:50.780 --> 03:40:54.274
All the colours in one class because they
have the similar thing,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15155-1
03:40:54.274 --> 03:40:56.763
but they have derived from the employee
class.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15155-2
03:40:56.763 --> 03:40:59.782
For example employee have the ID and name
qualification.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15155-3
03:40:59.782 --> 03:41:03.435
So every trainer have ID and name
qualification but the trainer have

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15155-4
03:41:03.435 --> 03:41:05.660
subject also what they are teaching right?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15190-0
03:41:06.300 --> 03:41:11.121
Then then the colour is doing something,
so we will think that way and then we

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15190-1
03:41:11.121 --> 03:41:15.271
will design the project.
We will not think only about the function.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15190-2
03:41:15.271 --> 03:41:19.543
So that programming is known as object
oriented programme. We got it.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15190-3
03:41:19.543 --> 03:41:21.740
What is object oriented programming?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15221-0
03:41:22.340 --> 03:41:27.092
Then we will start discussing it here it
what is OOP, oops,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15221-1
03:41:27.092 --> 03:41:33.350
object oriented programming concepts.
Then we are going to define a class what

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15221-2
03:41:33.350 --> 03:41:37.627
is a class.
Then we are going to create the object of

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15221-3
03:41:37.627 --> 03:41:38.420
the class.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15257-0
03:41:38.900 --> 03:41:42.059
Then we are going to discuss the methods
in the class.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15257-1
03:41:42.059 --> 03:41:45.046
Then we are going to discuss about the
constructor.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15257-2
03:41:45.046 --> 03:41:49.411
Constructor means to construct the class.
The initial initialise the class.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15257-3
03:41:49.411 --> 03:41:53.949
Then we will discuss the labs exercises
and then question answer that you will

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15257-4
03:41:53.949 --> 03:41:55.500
not answer. I will ask you.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15258-0
03:41:55.980 --> 03:41:56.380
Find.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15260-0
03:41:59.300 --> 03:41:59.620
OK.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15294-0
03:42:01.380 --> 03:42:07.300
So object oriented programming is a
programming paradise or concept based on

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15294-1
03:42:07.300 --> 03:42:12.375
the concept of objects.
This object oriented programming is based

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15294-2
03:42:12.375 --> 03:42:16.835
on the objects.
So here is key concept that you are going

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15294-3
03:42:16.835 --> 03:42:18.220
to learn here are.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15304-0
03:42:18.860 --> 03:42:26.540
Class object, method encapsulation,
inheritance, polymorphism.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15336-0
03:42:27.900 --> 03:42:31.792
So Python is fully supports object
oriented programming,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15336-1
03:42:31.792 --> 03:42:35.070
so we are going to discuss today class
objects.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15336-2
03:42:35.070 --> 03:42:38.962
Method is the functions you have right
inside the class.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15336-3
03:42:38.962 --> 03:42:43.060
It will write to the function that is
known as method here.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15345-0
03:42:43.620 --> 03:42:47.406
Same thing function we will put inside
the cloud that become methods.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15345-1
03:42:47.406 --> 03:42:48.380
That's the method.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15376-0
03:42:50.460 --> 03:42:54.057
So a class is a blueprint for creating
object.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15376-1
03:42:54.057 --> 03:43:00.180
I already told you class is a blueprint
of creating object or class is a object

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15376-2
03:43:00.180 --> 03:43:04.620
factory. Fine. Class is a template.
You can say anything.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15409-0
03:43:05.020 --> 03:43:10.443
Class is a template class.
Is a blueprint class. Is a object factory.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15409-1
03:43:10.443 --> 03:43:16.796
You can see any definition. All are same.
A class is a blueprint for creating the

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15409-2
03:43:16.796 --> 03:43:20.360
object.
Class is a template class is a object

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15409-3
03:43:20.360 --> 03:43:20.980
factory.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15452-0
03:43:21.340 --> 03:43:25.203
If one template you have designed,
this is the template.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15452-1
03:43:25.203 --> 03:43:28.863
Based on that we want to do, right?
So that is class.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15452-2
03:43:28.863 --> 03:43:33.878
So how we will write the class in
programming we will write class then we

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15452-3
03:43:33.878 --> 03:43:38.284
will write class name.
After that we will write all that methods

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15452-4
03:43:38.284 --> 03:43:40.860
attribute there. For example you have.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15479-0
03:43:41.020 --> 03:43:46.422
Created a class car so car is a class,
car is a object factory,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15479-1
03:43:46.422 --> 03:43:51.825
car is itself nothing.
So if once you will go let's say proton,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15479-2
03:43:51.825 --> 03:43:57.060
X-76 so that is one object of the car you
have write Hyundai.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15509-0
03:43:57.860 --> 03:44:02.392
Some car name so that is one object.
So car is a blueprint.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15509-1
03:44:02.392 --> 03:44:06.546
You tech said this is a car,
so car is nothing itself.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15509-2
03:44:06.546 --> 03:44:12.589
You say ACAC is nothing but once we'll
discuss that is the real time entity you

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15509-3
03:44:12.589 --> 03:44:13.420
say laptop.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15552-0
03:44:13.900 --> 03:44:20.003
Laptop is a class right in the laptop you
you have defined that in the laptop.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15552-1
03:44:20.003 --> 03:44:25.179
There should be some sort of RAM,
some sort of this one is screen,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15552-2
03:44:25.179 --> 03:44:30.587
screen size, Bluetooth, wireless.
This that all the characteristic of

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15552-3
03:44:30.587 --> 03:44:33.060
laptop you will write so laptop.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15589-0
03:44:33.260 --> 03:44:39.074
Is a blueprint. The laptop is a blueprint.
It is a object factory. It is a template.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15589-1
03:44:39.074 --> 03:44:42.153
Once you create the,
let's say this MacBook.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15589-2
03:44:42.153 --> 03:44:47.420
So MacBook is the real time entity.
This MI is a real time entity, this one.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15589-3
03:44:47.420 --> 03:44:50.020
This one is a real time entity, right?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15624-0
03:44:50.580 --> 03:44:55.536
So the class similarly in the programming
class means we will define the

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15624-1
03:44:55.536 --> 03:45:00.832
characteristic once we want to create the
object that is the real time ended,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15624-2
03:45:00.832 --> 03:45:05.789
got it. So class is a template.
Then we will create the real time object

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15624-3
03:45:05.789 --> 03:45:06.740
of that thing.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15641-0
03:45:07.980 --> 03:45:14.074
Here is objects are instance of a class.
Objects are instance of the class

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15641-1
03:45:14.074 --> 03:45:18.300
instance. Means real time entity instance.
Example.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15683-0
03:45:19.860 --> 03:45:25.015
See I you are.
Let's say you are telling two kids. See,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15683-1
03:45:25.015 --> 03:45:30.998
he or she asked you what is car.
So you will define what is car.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15683-2
03:45:30.998 --> 03:45:37.627
Then you will show her the example.
You will show some car that this is

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15683-3
03:45:37.627 --> 03:45:39.100
Hyundai this is.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15724-0
03:45:39.260 --> 03:45:43.676
Proton, this is Ferrari. This is that.
So those pictures you will show,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15724-1
03:45:43.676 --> 03:45:47.356
those are the instances.
Those are the examples. Similarly,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15724-2
03:45:47.356 --> 03:45:52.078
the objects are instance of a class.
For example you have created a car one.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15724-3
03:45:52.078 --> 03:45:55.820
So this is an object.
Then you will call those methods that.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15762-0
03:45:56.220 --> 03:45:59.554
Can do.
For example you have like describing the

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15762-1
03:45:59.554 --> 03:46:03.094
lion. So Lion have what lion can do.
Lion can roar.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15762-2
03:46:03.094 --> 03:46:08.130
Right Lion have four legs and all.
Then you you will create one object of

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15762-3
03:46:08.130 --> 03:46:13.098
lion and you can call those things.
So similarly here we will create the

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15762-4
03:46:13.098 --> 03:46:14.460
object and use them.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15792-0
03:46:15.500 --> 03:46:18.735
And then inside that we can write the
methods.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15792-1
03:46:18.735 --> 03:46:24.036
Methods are function defined inside a
class. You know the functions already.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15792-2
03:46:24.036 --> 03:46:29.820
So for example we have write the function
inside the class that is known as method.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15822-0
03:46:31.460 --> 03:46:37.274
For example, here is the simplest.
I'm writing the simple simple thing is

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15822-1
03:46:37.274 --> 03:46:40.810
here. For example,
you have created a class,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15822-2
03:46:40.810 --> 03:46:46.940
class name is let's say employee and in
the employee class you have a method.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15871-0
03:46:47.980 --> 03:46:52.168
Let me show you first this one,
we have a class dog inside that we have

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15871-1
03:46:52.168 --> 03:46:55.658
the method bark. Dog can bark right?
So this is the method.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15871-2
03:46:55.658 --> 03:47:00.428
Once we will create the object of the dog.
Let's say we have created object first

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15871-3
03:47:00.428 --> 03:47:03.569
dog right. So first dog can bark.
This is the method.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15871-4
03:47:03.569 --> 03:47:07.060
So method is function like the function
you write definite.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15878-0
03:47:07.140 --> 03:47:11.075
Function function name and here the
parameter call and then you have write to

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15878-1
03:47:11.075 --> 03:47:11.580
the value.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15912-0
03:47:14.140 --> 03:47:18.937
Functions you have done this function
inside the class. This is class dog colon.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15912-1
03:47:18.937 --> 03:47:23.795
Inside that you have write this one you
see the tab. So this is inside the class.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15912-2
03:47:23.795 --> 03:47:28.060
That's why we call it matter.
So function inside the class is known as.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15915-0
03:47:30.260 --> 03:47:32.220
Function inside the class is known as.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15917-0
03:47:33.860 --> 03:47:34.740
Methods, right?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15919-0
03:47:37.780 --> 03:47:38.140
OK.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15920-0
03:47:39.580 --> 03:47:40.260
There is.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15947-0
03:47:43.580 --> 03:47:47.843
There is one special kind of method
inside the class.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15947-1
03:47:47.843 --> 03:47:53.686
I repeat there is a one special kind of
method inside the class that runs

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15947-2
03:47:53.686 --> 03:47:58.740
automatically whenever you will create
the object of the class.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15982-0
03:47:59.700 --> 03:48:02.988
That method is known as constructor.
I repeat,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15982-1
03:48:02.988 --> 03:48:08.375
there is a special kind of method inside
the class that is run automatically

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15982-2
03:48:08.375 --> 03:48:11.873
whenever you will create the object of
the class.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15982-3
03:48:11.873 --> 03:48:16.351
See if you want to call the method,
how do you call the method?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15982-4
03:48:16.351 --> 03:48:18.660
You will let the object name dot.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15997-0
03:48:18.740 --> 03:48:23.194
Method name to call the method name.
But this constructor you need not to call

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/15997-1
03:48:23.194 --> 03:48:26.860
whenever you will create the object,
it is called automatically.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16012-0
03:48:28.900 --> 03:48:34.707
So this method is known as constructor
and the name of this method is always in

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16012-1
03:48:34.707 --> 03:48:36.740
it. You will light this way.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16065-0
03:48:38.540 --> 03:48:42.440
Underscore INIT underscore method that is
constructor.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16065-1
03:48:42.440 --> 03:48:48.113
This will be the same in this Python.
It will be the you have to write this way

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16065-2
03:48:48.113 --> 03:48:53.857
in other programming the this constructor
have the same name as class but forget

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16065-3
03:48:53.857 --> 03:48:57.900
about other programming.
In Python you have to use this.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16100-0
03:48:57.980 --> 03:49:03.073
This one this is in need.
This is constructor so constructor is a

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16100-1
03:49:03.073 --> 03:49:09.015
special kind of method that is called
automatically whenever you will create

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16100-2
03:49:09.015 --> 03:49:13.491
the object of the class.
It is used to initialise objects

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16100-3
03:49:13.491 --> 03:49:14.340
attributes.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16106-0
03:49:14.940 --> 03:49:18.220
Where we use we use to initialization
purpose.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16116-0
03:49:22.140 --> 03:49:26.860
Let me show you one example.
Should I show you one practical of clause?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16127-0
03:49:28.860 --> 03:49:32.966
The rest theory will write later on.
We'll discuss later on.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16127-1
03:49:32.966 --> 03:49:34.380
So here is the class.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16130-0
03:49:41.740 --> 03:49:43.220
Yes, you want to say something.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16133-0
03:49:46.500 --> 03:49:47.420
Was he? Excuse me?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16138-0
03:49:52.540 --> 03:49:55.620
See here. We will go here.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16139-0
03:49:57.020 --> 03:49:57.060
Uh.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16146-0
03:50:10.900 --> 03:50:12.060
This is your folder, huh?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16151-0
03:50:16.860 --> 03:50:19.140
A5 Let me open it.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16183-0
03:50:22.060 --> 03:50:26.578
Just one example that we will do this
object under programming Monday from

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16183-1
03:50:26.578 --> 03:50:31.338
scratch. Just to start you can read out.
I will share this content during this

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16183-2
03:50:31.338 --> 03:50:34.470
Saturday,
Sunday right we will start it from Monday

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16183-3
03:50:34.470 --> 03:50:36.700
but just one example I'm showing you.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16185-0
03:50:37.340 --> 03:50:38.340
Here I'm writing the.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16189-0
03:50:46.340 --> 03:50:47.620
What the name you want to give?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16195-0
03:50:55.660 --> 03:50:59.740
OOP example one dot π.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16206-0
03:51:02.260 --> 03:51:06.980
Object oriented concept example one dot Y
you have right here.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16211-0
03:51:09.940 --> 03:51:11.580
Let me just write from scratch.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16219-0
03:51:14.260 --> 03:51:17.900
You have right class class name is let's
say employee.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16221-0
03:51:19.340 --> 03:51:20.500
You are a deaf.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16223-0
03:51:25.540 --> 03:51:26.180
The spelling.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16224-0
03:51:31.020 --> 03:51:31.300
And.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16226-0
03:51:35.060 --> 03:51:36.220
Display off.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16229-0
03:51:38.020 --> 03:51:39.780
Employee glass.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16230-0
03:51:42.500 --> 03:51:42.620
Yeah.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16241-0
03:51:48.340 --> 03:51:52.536
Fine, just this one.
One method we are right inside the

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16241-1
03:51:52.536 --> 03:51:53.660
employee class.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16245-0
03:51:56.460 --> 03:51:58.460
Done right.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16271-0
03:52:18.820 --> 03:52:22.487
That reboot nothing I have write this one
function.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16271-1
03:52:22.487 --> 03:52:28.201
One method I have write so how we will
call the method we will create the object

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16271-2
03:52:28.201 --> 03:52:31.940
of the class to create the object will
write EMPOBJ.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16279-0
03:52:39.780 --> 03:52:42.500
We'll create the object and we'll call.
We'll do it first.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16283-0
03:52:56.300 --> 03:53:02.180
E of employee dot.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16285-0
03:53:04.180 --> 03:53:04.900
Let's spell it.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16299-0
03:53:09.300 --> 03:53:13.905
We have created the object.
This is object let me call it obj.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16299-1
03:53:13.905 --> 03:53:15.660
This is obj dot display.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16309-0
03:53:52.860 --> 03:53:54.220
This is one object, right?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16314-0
03:54:00.340 --> 03:54:02.220
It is CLS clear screen.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16319-0
03:54:04.380 --> 03:54:07.540
You have right here Python.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16329-0
03:54:09.540 --> 03:54:16.620
And here is 4 OP underscore EX1 dot π.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16330-0
03:54:23.620 --> 03:54:23.980
Open.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16333-0
03:54:31.740 --> 03:54:33.220
He's giving some hand.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16376-0
03:54:53.060 --> 03:54:56.441
Suzanne means we are not passing any
parameter here,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16376-1
03:54:56.441 --> 03:55:01.163
so it's just add the rate of employee
it's inside this without parameter.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16376-2
03:55:01.163 --> 03:55:05.821
If you want we have to write inside the
class we have to write the self.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16376-3
03:55:05.821 --> 03:55:10.925
So now it's OK see this the function and
this one is just you have to pass from

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16376-4
03:55:10.925 --> 03:55:11.500
yourself.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16381-0
03:55:13.220 --> 03:55:15.180
Otherwise, we'll be better do it.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16395-0
03:55:33.500 --> 03:55:37.740
We have created this object and then we
have just called the display.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16420-0
03:55:50.900 --> 03:55:55.016
The syntax is clear. We will write this.
This is the syntax.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16420-1
03:55:55.016 --> 03:55:59.605
Let me write the syntax for you.
You're down. So we'll write class.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16420-2
03:55:59.605 --> 03:56:02.980
This is keyword.
Then we'll write the class name.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16435-0
03:56:04.740 --> 03:56:08.984
Class name. Then we'll let this colon.
After that,

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16435-1
03:56:08.984 --> 03:56:11.980
we will let the definition of class.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16436-0
03:56:19.940 --> 03:56:20.500
Plus.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16453-0
03:56:24.220 --> 03:56:29.443
Tribute method, ETC,
method constructors ETC.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16453-1
03:56:29.443 --> 03:56:37.620
Whatever you want to write you can write
after that right constructors.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16468-0
03:56:39.060 --> 03:56:46.540
Then to call the this one to use the
class. The syntax it will light the.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16477-0
03:56:48.900 --> 03:56:56.180
Object name could be anything,
object name is equal to class name.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16486-0
03:56:58.700 --> 03:57:03.980
That's very good. And to call it,
we will let object name dot.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16488-0
03:57:08.460 --> 03:57:09.260
My third name.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16500-0
03:57:11.980 --> 03:57:16.660
And from here we will pass the arguments
if it is any parameters here.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16543-0
03:57:22.220 --> 03:57:26.378
It is not anything we will just remove
this without the method.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16543-1
03:57:26.378 --> 03:57:31.122
So here is see here class name is
employee so we have created the object

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16543-2
03:57:31.122 --> 03:57:34.306
object name could be anything we have
write obj.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16543-3
03:57:34.306 --> 03:57:37.230
You can write ABCD anything obj dot
display.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16543-4
03:57:37.230 --> 03:57:40.740
If you want to create one more object you
can create.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16548-0
03:57:40.780 --> 03:57:45.700
You can write here.
Let's say EE is equal to.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16574-0
03:57:47.140 --> 03:57:49.874
EMP.
So there is one more object you have

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16574-1
03:57:49.874 --> 03:57:55.148
created. Then you are write E dot display.
You have called the display again you

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16574-2
03:57:55.148 --> 03:57:56.060
want to print.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16580-0
03:57:57.500 --> 03:58:00.660
You can print it again, so here is.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16605-0
03:58:02.860 --> 03:58:11.523
What? What is the name of file Python,
the name OOP underscore EX1 dot PY so

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16605-1
03:58:11.523 --> 03:58:20.300
display of employee class display of
employee Class 2 objects I have created.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16627-0
03:58:20.980 --> 03:58:24.844
And I have call it twice,
so this is the first object.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16627-1
03:58:24.844 --> 03:58:29.129
This is first employee for example.
This is second employee.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16627-2
03:58:29.129 --> 03:58:31.940
You can call it anything OBJ E1E2 right?

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16655-0
03:58:33.500 --> 03:58:38.808
So I have just tell you how to write the
class and how to access the method from

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16655-1
03:58:38.808 --> 03:58:42.741
the class, right?
All object oriented programming things we

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16655-2
03:58:42.741 --> 03:58:47.460
will discuss Monday in the details that's
here just to start something.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16666-0
03:59:28.660 --> 03:59:31.020
Online 1 clear up to this level.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16668-0
03:59:33.620 --> 03:59:34.220
OK, Sir.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16671-0
03:59:34.700 --> 03:59:35.780
Clear, Sir.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16672-0
03:59:39.740 --> 03:59:39.980
Play song.

57efaad6-37ee-490e-a21a-3901552b1b14/16673-0
